A 10% tariff was imposed on all countries, with higher tariffs on countries with large trade deficits [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9) [whitehouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).\n\n**Economic Impact:**\n\n*   The OBBB is projected to reduce federal tax revenue by \\$5 trillion between 2025 and 2034 [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). Dynamic scoring suggests that economic growth could offset some of these losses [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n*   The OBBB is estimated to increase long-run GDP by 1.2 percent [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n*   Extending the TCJA would decrease federal tax revenue [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n*   Tariffs are expected to increase federal tax revenues but may also reduce US GDP [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9).\n\n**Other Proposals and Considerations:**\n\n*   Trump has also pledged to remove taxes on Social Security benefits [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8) [whitehouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).\n*   Republicans in Congress are considering cuts to social programs to offset the cost of tax cuts [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8).\n*   The administration has emphasized deregulation and energy competitiveness [whitehouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).\n*   Some analysts predict a possible recession in 2025 [cepr](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-11).\n*   The FDDEI deduction is reduced from 37.5% to 33.34%, which increases the effective tax rate on FDDEII from 13.125% to 14%. These changes apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2025 [proskauertaxtalks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n', 'The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), signed into law on July 4, 2025, includes several mechanisms intended to offset its revenue losses, though these appear insufficient to fully cover the costs [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1). The Act permanently extends many of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions, adds new tax cuts, and increases spending in certain areas [adb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n\nHere\'s a breakdown of proposed offset mechanisms:\n\n*   **Spending Cuts:**\n    *   The OBBB includes over $1 trillion in spending cuts [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n    *   Significant cuts are made to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n    *   The Act reduces spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) [sustainableagriculture](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5) [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n    *   There are cuts to clean energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [thomsonreuters](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6) [adb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n    *   Reforms to student loan programs are also included [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n    *   The Senate budget resolution called for $4 billion in spending cuts [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1).\n*   **Revenue Increases (Beyond Dynamic Scoring):**\n    *   The law includes about $350 billion in revenue-increasing provisions and offsetting receipts [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n    *   A 1% tax is imposed on remittances [adb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1).\n    *   There are higher levies on university endowments [adb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [bdo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7). The OBBB will increase the 1.4% tax on net investment income of private colleges and universities, but it will limit the application of the tax to universities with at least 3,000 tuition-paying students (up from 500) [bdo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7). The OBBB imposes a new rate structure with excise taxes up to 8% [bdo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7).\n    *   The Act saves $540 billion from restricting and phasing out tax credits for clean energy and electric vehicles enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n*   **Dynamic Scoring:**\n    *   The OBBB anticipates $940 billion in dynamic revenue feedback [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8).\n    *   The Tax Foundation estimates the tax law will increase long-run GDP by 1.2 percent [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-9) [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8).\n    *   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the act will raise U.S. GDP by an average of 0.5% between 2025 and 2034, peaking at 0.9% in 2026 [adb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n*   **Other potential offsets and considerations:**\n    *   The White House argues that economic growth from provisions like "no tax on overtime" and "no tax on tips" could generate $54 to $73 billion in higher revenue [whitehouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-10).\n    *   The White House also points to full expensing of equipment investment and R&D as drivers of economic growth [whitehouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-10).\n    *   The Act increases the small business tax deduction used by 26 million entrepreneurs annually from 20% to 23% [whitehouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-11).\n    *   The Act also restores 100% immediate expensing, allowing businesses to write off investments, expansion, and modernization [whitehouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-11).\n\n**Net Impact:**\n\n*   Despite these measures, the OBBB is projected to increase borrowing by $4.1 trillion through 2034 [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n*   The net deficit impact of the law is estimated at $3 trillion over the next decade, even after accounting for dynamic revenue feedback and spending cuts [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n*   The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the law will add over $5.5 trillion to the debt through 2034 on a permanent basis [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n*   The CBO estimates the law will increase the budget deficit by $2.8 trillion by 2034 [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1).\n*   BPC estimates the additional debt required from OBBB will add over $700 billion in interest expense to the law’s budgetary effects, meaning that with interest, it will cost more than $4.1 trillion from FY2025-2034.\n [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0)\n**Contradictory Claims:**\n\n*   Some policymakers claim the OBBB reduces federal deficits using a "current policy" baseline, assuming expiring TCJA policies were never set to expire.\n [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0)*   However, the conventional view is that the OBBB increases the deficit.\n [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8) [taxfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-9) [crfb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4)\nIn summary, while the OBBB attempts to offset revenue losses through spending cuts and some revenue increases, it is still projected to significantly increase the national debt.\n [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1)
