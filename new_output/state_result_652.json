More recently, a regulatory substitution in *FOXP2* was identified that is almost fixed in modern human populations but absent in Neanderthals and Denisovans [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-9). Another gene, *NOVA1*, produces a neuron-specific RNA binding protein crucial for neural development [neurosciencenews](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5) [news-medical](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [theneurotimes](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-15) [thebrighterside](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-12) [apnews](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0].

Modern humans possess a unique vocal tract compared to other primates [thewire](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [penn](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8]. The human larynx is much lower, relative to cervical vertebrae, than that of our ancestors and other primates [smithsonianmag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4]. The human supralaryngeal vocal tract acquires a roughly 1:1 relationship between horizontal and vertical sections [frontiersin](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10], which is important for producing the full range of human speech sounds [uchicago](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [penn](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2].

This is significantly earlier than previous estimates of around 200,000 years ago [tvpworld](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-10) [greekreporter](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-9).\n*   **Evidence for Early Speech:** This conclusion is based on archaeological findings, ancient bones, genetic data, brain studies, and language research [tvpworld](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-10) [greekreporter](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-9). Key developments include the rapid increase in human brain size starting around 2 million BC, the emergence of Broca\'s area, advanced bipedalism, and alterations in the shape of the human skull [tvpworld](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-10) [greekreporter](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-9).\n*   **Later Developments:** Fully human speech anatomy may have first appeared in the fossil record in the Upper Paleolithic, around 50,000 years ago [uchicago](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [penn](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2). The specialized anatomy and neural mechanisms that confer fully human speech, language, and cognitive ability may have reached their present state sometime between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago [penn](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2).\n*   **Gradual Development:** Linguistic development likely continued over hundreds of thousands of years, becoming more complex with the emergence of anatomically modern humans around 150,000 years ago [tvpworld](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-10).\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n*   Speech capacity cannot be inferred only from cerebral conditions; hypotheses should combine various lines of evidence [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-11).\n*   The ability to make contrasting vowel sounds is a critical component of functional human speech [smithsonianmag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0).\n*   The evolution of human speech capabilities likely required neural changes rather than just modifications of vocal anatomy [smithsonianmag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0).\n*   While anatomical features are important, the brain\'s capacity to control speech production and hearing is also crucial [smithsonianmag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0).\n*   The origin of speech differs from the origin of language, as language can be written or signed [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4).\n*   Speech allowed humans to share information, coordinate activities, and pass down knowledge, giving them an advantage over other hominins [apnews](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6).\n', 'Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on "How did the shift in diet and food processing techniques (e.g., cooking) specifically influence the physical changes in hominin vocal tract anatomy and brain development related to speech?" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nThe evolution of hominin vocal tract anatomy and brain development related to speech was influenced by shifts in diet and food processing techniques [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [toppandigital](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1). These changes are interconnected and likely reinforced each other [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n\n**Dietary Changes and Vocal Tract Anatomy:**\n\n*   **Reduction in Masticatory Structures:** The incorporation of processed and cooked foods coincided with significant reductions in the mandible, masticatory muscles, and overall vocal tract anatomy in hominins [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-2) [osf](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3). This is because food processing, including slicing and pounding with stone tools, reduced the need for large faces and teeth, which were previously required to chew tougher foods [carnisostenibili](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4).\n*   **Gracilization of the Mandible:** Food processing essentially "outsourced" some of the chewing work to the hands and tools, which reduced the selection pressure for robust mandibles [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-2) [osf](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3).\n*   **Overbite Development:** Softer foods, particularly those associated with agriculture and food processing technologies like industrial milling, led to less tooth wear and the retention of a juvenile overbite into adulthood [zmescience](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5) [mpg](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6). This altered bite allowed for the production of new sounds like "f" and "v" (labiodentals), which are common in many modern languages [mpg](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6) [zmescience](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5).\n*   **Tongue position:** The descent and change in shape of the tongue are key factors in the development and evolution of the human vocal tract [uchicago](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7).\n\n**Dietary Changes and Brain Development:**\n\n*   **Expensive Tissue Hypothesis (ETH):** A high-quality, easy-to-digest diet, particularly one including meat, allowed for a reduction in gut size, freeing up energy to support the metabolically expensive brain [harvard](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8) [kernsverlag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-9) [wfu](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-10) [toppandigital](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1).

Cooking increases the digestibility of both meat and plant foods [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-13).\n*   **External Fermentation Hypothesis:** The adoption of fermentation technology by early hominins may have been a key mechanism for human brain expansion and gut reduction [news-medical](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-15) [sciencealert](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-16). Fermented foods are easier to digest and contain more available nutrients than their raw equivalents [sciencealert](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-16).\n*   **Diet Quality:** Brain size in primates is predicted by diet [technologynetworks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-17). Complex foraging strategies and cognitive abilities likely co-evolved with diet throughout primate evolution [technologynetworks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-17).\n\n**Food Processing and Energetic Efficiency:**\n\n*   **Reduced Chewing Effort:** Processing food, especially meat, before eating it decreased the effort needed to chew and made chewing more effective [carnisostenibili](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4). Slicing meat and pounding vegetables reduced the muscular effort per chew and the number of chews required per day [carnisostenibili](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4).\n*   **Increased Caloric Availability:** Cooking and processing increased the net caloric gain from food, providing more energy for brain function [toppandigital](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-14).\n\n**Labiodental sounds:**\n\n*   Dental changes allow new sounds. In Europe, data suggests that the use of labiodentals has increased dramatically only in the last couple of millennia, correlated with the rise of food processing technology such as industrial milling [mpg](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6).\n\n**Caveats and Considerations:**\n\n*   While diet and food processing played a significant role, other factors also contributed to the evolution of speech and brain development, including social organization, tool use, and neural development [pbs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-18) [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n*   The precise timing and specific contributions of each factor are still debated [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-13).\n*   Some researchers suggest that the cooking of food is not sufficient nor necessary to explain hominin brain expansion [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-11) [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-19).\n*   The relationship between brain size and sociality is also debated, with some research suggesting that diet is a more important factor in determining brain size [technologynetworks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-17).\n*   The human supralaryngeal vocal tract increases the risk of choking to death on food lodged in the larynx [uchicago](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7).\n'], 'sources_gathered': [{'label': 'researchgate', 'short_url':
