While specific swath widths for KH-11 in 2025 are unavailable, it can be assumed that it is at least as wide as HEXAGON, if not wider [nro](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6).\n*   **Data Latency:** KH-11 was the first near-real-time reconnaissance satellite capable of transmitting imagery nearly instantaneously [thespacereview](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7). Data is transmitted to ground stations using Satellite Data System (SDS) communication satellites [designation-systems](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5). By 2025, real-time tactical intelligence is a necessity for military commanders [breakingdefense](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8). Therefore, KH-11 likely has a data latency of only minutes [breakingdefense](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8) [thespacereview](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7).\n*   **Resolution:** The best-case ground resolution of KH-11 is expected to be in the order of 15 cm (6 in) or better [designation-systems](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5). Images of a damaged launch pad in Iran taken by a KH-11 satellite had a ground resolution of 10 cm [euro-sd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-9).
