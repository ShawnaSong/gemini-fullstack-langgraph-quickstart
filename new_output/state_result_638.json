If that wasn\'t enough, Aloy our main protagonist can control an AI named GAIA. What we\'re having here is an exciting connection with "very old times" and "near future", even though the game is set up in the 31st century.\nBeing an outcast with her father Rost, Aloy must restore her position in the tribe and save the world by stopping the Eclipse, a cult that wants to rule the world.

ALWAYS INCLUDE THEIR EYE COLOR, HAIR COLOR AND HAIRSTYLE. DO NOT EVER EXCLUDE THIS INFORMATION. If other characters are included in the prompt, describe them in the same amount of details as the girls - do not just drop a proper noun with no context. Intelligently come up with scenes related to the mission below. \n\nREVENGE OF THE NORA (TWENTY-TWO PROMPTS)\n\nPROMPT 1. To begin this quest, we’ll need to make our way north to the objective marker at the Red Echoes area. Note that if you keep to the main road leading north from the ‘The War-Chief’s Trail’ mission, you’ll encounter a pair of groups of machines blocking the path. The first is made up of Scrappers and Watchers, whilst the second features two Sawtooths and some Watchers – so either sneak on by or take them out.\n\nPROMPT 2. When you reach the objective marker, you’ll discover that it is indicating a campfire. Approach this and rest to trigger a scene.\n\nPROMPT 3. Clear the Camps\nFollowing the scene, you’ll see that three Cultist camps have been added to the map across the river to the east in the ruins of Devil’s Grief. We’ll need to approach each of these three camps one at a time, kill its inhabitants and disable the alarm inside.\n\nPROMPT 4. First Camp\nThe first camp is directly east of the starting location. This consists of a large, square-shaped ruined building. Two Corrupted Watchers will patrol the fields outside the eastern side of the camp – note that both will patrol through sections of tall grass which can be used for Silent Strikes if you wish to do so. There are 4-5 Cultists in and around the building and most can be killed stealthily by shooting the Blaze canisters around the area.\n\nPROMPT 5. To enter the camp quietly, at the northwestern corner of the ruin, you’ll find a ladder leading up inside. Clear out any remaining enemies before approaching and interacting with the alarm to disable it. Just south of this camp, along the main path leading east, there is a piece of Ancient Debris to loot for a collectible (Ancient Vessel – Miriam).\n\nPROMPT 6. Second Camp\nThe second camp can be found just to the southeast of the first camp. There is a group of Corrupted Watchers between the two camps if you follow the game’s suggested route, but they are easy enough to avoid using the abundance of tall grass and cover about.\n\nPROMPT 7. The second camp site is a series of wooden platforms set up over a swampy section of ground with water beneath them. It is guarded by around 8-9 Cultists, and like the previous one the majority of them can be taken out fairly quickly by utilizing the strategically placed Blaze barrels around the area. Approach from the east, or from the ridge to the south (where the Braves will be waiting to help you) and use these relatively clear positions to shoot the Blaze and pick off any remaining stragglers with headshots.\n\nPROMPT 8. Drop down into the camp quietly and clear out any remaining enemies before approaching and interacting with the alarm to disable it.\n\nPROMPT 9. Third Camp\nThe third camp centres around a supply shack of sorts and is guarded by another 8-9 Cultists. There are several instances of tall ground around its outskirts which can be used effectively to lure and kill enemies one at a time, but also provide decent cover for shooting Blaze barrels in the camp itself (although its tricky to kill enemies with these this time around). If tall grass isn’t your thing, you can always use the buildings on each side of the camp as cover and use their upper ledges as vantage points from which to pick off the Cultists.\n\nPROMPT 10. When it is safe to do so, head on into the camp quietly and clear out any remaining enemies before approaching and interacting with the alarm to disable it.\n\nPROMPT 11. With all three camps successfully cleared, make your way to the base of the tallest tower in the Devil’s Grief ruins which can be found to the east. As you arrive, speak with Sona for a scene to continue the mission.\n\nPROMPT 12. Follow Varl\nAfter the meeting with Sona, you’ll be teaming up with Varl for the next little while. Follow him as he leads you towards the Ring of Steel to the north. Approach Varl when he stops to climb up into the ruins and walk to the far end of the platform to the right.\n\nPROMPT 13. At the end, you’ll spot an enemy below and another a little further ahead. Perform a Strike from Above attack on the fellow below before sneaking up on the next and use Silent Strike to eliminate him. Keep moving north until you reach a wooden barricade. Climb the wall to the left and drop down the other side. Enter the tall grass by the end of the ruined bus and when the two enemies come into view, kill the one on the left, Varl should take out the other.\n\nPROMPT 14. At the top of the slope, climb up onto the ledge on the left for another scene. Our objectives will update once again.\n\nPROMPT 15. Sneak to the Blaze\nWhen you regain control of Aloy once again, you’ll be overlooking a large area filled with Cultists, Corrupted Watchers, a Corrupted Fire Bellowback and Corruptors. It’s kind of silly to take them all on right now due to the sheer number advantage (although you can if you truly want), so instead, let\'s sneak to the Blaze shack.\nFrom the start, drop down into the tall grass below and from the edge of this, perform a strike from above on the Cultist below. Enter the small trench at the base of the large wooden wall and follow it to the end.\n\nPROMPT 16. When the short wall on the right stops, peek to the left to make sure there is no Corrupted Watcher looking in your direction, before continuing forward a short distance and re-entering the trench ahead with the water.\n\nPROMPT 17. Climb the slope to the left of the second trench and immediately enter the tall grass to the right at the top. Avoid the Cultists and move sneakily to the right of the shack and into the second piece of tall grass on the slope next to it. From this location, you should be able to see the Blaze. Hit it with a fire arrow to trigger a scene.\n\nPROMPT 18. Kill the Cultists and Machines\nFollowing the scene, you’ll be thrust into a fight against the remaining Cultist forces which include a dozen or so Cultists, 3-4 Corrupted Watchers and the Fire Bellowback. The Bellowback is the biggest threat during this attack sequence, so try to keep an eye on it (it\'s big so it shouldn’t be too hard) whilst you focus on helping the other Nora to eliminate the other, lesser enemies.\n\nPROMPT 19. Defeat the Corrupted Fire Bellowback\nWhen the Bellowback is pretty much by itself, we can take it on. The Bellowback has a number of damaging attacks, usually focused around fire-based damage. It will spray a directed beam of fire in the direction of an attack with a decent range and can also perform a spinning flame thrower attack which will damage anyone that gets too close to it. Addiitonally, it can stomp and perform a leaping charge attack which can knock you down.\n\nPROMPT 20. Upon scanning the Fire Bellowback, you’ll discover that it has three weaknesses. First, it has a large cargo sac on its back which, if destroyed will disable the long-range fire attacks. Second, the series of gullets below its head are also weak points and will disable the flame throwing attacks altogether if destroyed. Destroying either of these two weak spots will also trigger an explosion which will cause fire damage to anyone in the vicinity. Finally, the Fire Bellowback also has canisters of Blaze mounted on its legs. Unfortunately, they are hidden beneath armor panels which we’ll need to remove before they can be targeted – shooting the Blaze canisters with Fire Arrows will have them explode.\n\nPROMPT 21. The trick to defeating the Fire Bellowback is to keep your distance as much as possible to avoid the ranged flame attacks whilst firing your own arrows at the Fire Bellowback’s weak points. If it does get too close to you, run away to the far side of the area and repeat. Disable its flame attacks as soon as possible to reduce the threat that it poses (but get ready to dodge a lot more) and try and remove armor from its body and legs so that you can target the Blaze canisters for some massive damage.\n\nPROMPT 22. Once the Fire Bellowback is dead, kill any remaining enemies. After everything is dead, a scene will play to complete the mission.\n\nEvery prompt has to be extremely, specifically evocative of the video game "Horizon Zero Dawn". Generic images that look like they could be part of any old game ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE. Prompts where they\'re idly standing around or doing something visually uninteresting ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE.\xa0NO HUD ELEMENTS, THEY ARE PHYSICALLY IN THE WORLD OF THE GAME.
