However, some USB devices may not be fully compatible with this feature and may misbehave, requiring a reboot to work again [hamwaves](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-2) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-3). This is often caused by the device not behaving according to the USB standard [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-3).\n\nHere\'s a breakdown of USB autosuspend and how to manage it:\n\n**What is USB Autosuspend?**\n\n*   It\'s a power-saving technique where the OS suspends USB devices that appear idle [kernel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-1) [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0). A device is considered idle when the kernel thinks it\'s not doing anything important [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0).\n*   When a suspended device is needed, the kernel automatically resumes it [kernel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-1).\n\n**Why Disable USB Autosuspend?**\n\n*   Some devices, like certain USB mice and keyboards, may exhibit issues when autosuspend is enabled [hamwaves](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-2).\n*   The AM01 device does not support the suspended state as it is designed to work 24/7 [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0).\n*   Problems can arise from misinterpretations of the eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) specification [hamwaves](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-2).\n\n**How to Check if USB Autosuspend is Enabled**\n\n*   Run the following command in the terminal: `cat /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/autosuspend` [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-3). The result will be the idle-delay time.\n\n**Methods to Disable USB Autosuspend:**\n\n1.  **Kernel Parameter:**\n\n    *   Add `usbcore.autosuspend=-1` to the kernel command line [home-assistant](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-4) [manjaro](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-5) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-3). This disables USB autosuspend completely [manjaro](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-5).\n    *   For Ubuntu, modify `/etc/default/grub`:\n\n        ```\n        sudo sed -i \'s/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="[a-z ]*/& usbcore.autosuspend=-1/\' /etc/default/grub\n        sudo update-grub2\n        reboot\n        ```\n\n    *   For Raspbian OS, add `usbcore.autosuspend=-1` to `/boot/cmdline.txt` [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0).\n    *   For other single-board computers, the kernel parameters can likely be found in `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf` [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0).\n    *   After rebooting, verify the value with: `cat /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/autosuspend` [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-3). It should display `-1` [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-6).\n2.  **TLP (Linux Power Management Tool):**\n\n    *   Install TLP: `sudo apt install tlp` [newnex](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-7) [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0).\n    *   Edit `/etc/default/tlp` and set `USB_AUTOSUSPEND=0` to disable autosuspend system-wide [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0).\n    *   To blacklist specific devices, add their VID:PID to the `USB_BLACKLIST` parameter [atomminer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-0) [askubuntu](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-8).

The newer file expresses the delay in milliseconds, whereas the older file uses seconds [kernel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-1).\n*   By default, the kernel disables autosuspend for all devices other than hubs [kernel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-1) [kernel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-10).\n*   If using laptop-mode-tools or powertop, eliminate them as potential causes of the problem before modifying USB autosuspend settings [hamwaves](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-2).\n*   Some kernels might require `autosuspend=0` [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-6).\n*   If your system uses `initrd`, rebuild it after making changes [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-6).\n*   In some cases, a USB hub might resolve disconnection issues [home-assistant](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/11-4).\n', 'Okay, I will conduct Google Searches to gather the most recent information on "compositor latency" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nCompositor latency refers to the delay between a user\'s input (like a keypress or mouse movement) and the corresponding visual update on the screen [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-0) [lofibucket](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-1). It\'s a complex issue influenced by various factors, including the compositor itself, vertical synchronization (V-Sync), and hardware capabilities [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-2) [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-3) [lofibucket](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-1).\n\n**Sources of Compositor Latency:**\n\n*   **Compositing Process:** Compositing window managers use off-screen buffers for each window and then display all the windows together, which inevitably leads to some latency increase [lofibucket](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-1). Stacking window managers, in contrast, have applications draw directly in the framebuffer, which introduces no additional delays [lofibucket](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-1).\n*   **Vertical Synchronization (V-Sync):** Compositing window managers often enforce V-Sync, which requires waiting for the screen to display a frame before drawing the next one, adding latency [lofibucket](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-1). The maximum delay can be ~17 ms, with an average delay of ~8 ms for a 60 Hz refresh rate [lofibucket](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-1).\n*   **Decoupling of Updates:** Compositors decouple window update notifications from screen updates and perform screen updates at a predefined interval, usually the monitor refresh rate [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-0). This can cause a delay of a few milliseconds behind the user\'s actions [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-0).\n*   **Rendering Pipeline:** The "render to back buffer" and the "blit to the front buffer" operations do not happen at the same time, contributing to latency [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-0).\n*   **Multiple Windows:** The compositor has to manage multiple windows from multiple programs, making it impossible for a single window to dictate compositor updates [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-0).\n*   **Hardware limitations:** Slow CPUs and GPUs, especially when paired with high-resolution screens, can cause the compositor to miss the deadline to render a new frame every 16.67ms, resulting in stutters [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-4).\n\n**Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n*   **Disable Compositing:** In some operating systems like Linux, disabling the compositor can reduce input latency [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-5) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-6).\n*   **Optimize Compositor Settings:** Some desktop environments, like KDE, allow users to adjust compositor latency settings [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-5) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-7). However, the "force lowest latency" setting can sometimes cause dropped frames [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-7). In Plasma 6, the latency setting was removed because latency has been improved to the point where it no longer makes sense to ask the user to make a trade-off [kde](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-8) [kde](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-9).\n*   **Reduce Overdraw:** Overdraw (when pixels are drawn multiple times in the same frame) can increase latency. Modern GUI frameworks designed for the GPU can help minimize the impact of overdraw [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-3).\n*   **Hardware Overlays:** Transferring some of the compositor\'s functions to specialized hardware, like hardware overlays, can reduce latency [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-2) [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-3).\n*   **Beam Racing:** Running the compositor to race the beam, similar to techniques used in high-performance emulation, could resolve latency issues [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-2).\n*   **Optimize Refresh Rate:** Setting the display to its maximum refresh rate can reduce scanout latency [nvidia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-10).\n*   **Faster Hardware:** Investing in a faster CPU and GPU can significantly reduce latency [nvidia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-10).\n*   **Kernel Optimization:** Using a low-latency kernel can help reduce input lag [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-5).\n*   **Proper Configuration:** Configuring the system properly, such as setting USB ports, can help reduce input delay [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-11).\n*   **Embrace the compositor:** Design the app around the compositor by sending a tree of layers and small deltas to that tree [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-3).\n\n**Wayland and Compositor Latency:**\n\nWayland, a display server protocol, has the potential to reduce latency if the compositor is designed with that goal in mind [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-3). KDE\'s KWin compositor has merged its Wayland explicit sync support [phoronix](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-12).\n\n**KWin Improvements:**\n\nRecent improvements in KWin\'s compositing scheduling aim to reduce latency [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-4) [vladzahorodnii](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-13). KWin now uses a scheduling mechanism to start compositing later, reducing unnecessary latency [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-4). It also uses OpenGL query objects to figure out how long compositing takes on the GPU [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-4).\n\n**Niri Compositor:**\n\nNiri is a scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor that focuses on measuring and minimizing input latency [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-14) [phoronix](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-12).\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n*   **Monitor Response Time:** A monitor\'s pixel response time also affects display latency [nvidia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-10) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-11).\n*   **Input Device Latency:** The latency of input devices like mice and keyboards can also contribute to overall latency [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/12-11).\n', 'Okay, I will conduct Google Searches to gather the most recent and credible information on "mouse polling rate" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nMouse polling rate, also known as report rate, is how frequently a mouse communicates its position to a computer, measured in Hertz (Hz) [wordpress](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/13-0) [keychron](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/13-1) [akkogear](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/13-2) [attackshark](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/13-3).

By adjusting the priority level, users can influence which applications or tasks receive more or less CPU attention [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0). This is especially useful when dealing with resource-intensive applications or optimizing system performance, particularly when running multiple applications simultaneously [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0).\n\n**How to Set CPU Priority (Windows 10)**\n\n1.  **Access Task Manager:** Open Task Manager to access settings for CPU process priority [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0). This utility provides detailed information about running processes [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0).\n2.  **Navigate to Details View:** In Task Manager, select the "Processes" tab and locate the application to be adjusted [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0). Right-click the application and select "Go to details" to switch to the "Details" view [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0).\n3.  **Set Priority:** In the "Details" tab, right-click the process and select "Set priority" from the context menu [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0). Choose a priority level from the submenu [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0). Higher levels give the process more CPU time but can impact system stability [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0).\n4.  **Monitor Performance:** After changing priorities, monitor the application\'s performance to verify the adjustment meets the user\'s needs [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0).\n\n**Priority Levels**\n\nWindows shares processor resources between all running processes based on their priority level [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-1). There are several priority levels to choose from:\n\n*   **Realtime:** This gives a process the highest priority, potentially impacting system stability [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-1). It should only be used for time-critical applications [superuser](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-2). Setting a CPU-intensive program to real-time can cause it to monopolize the processor, leaving few cycles for other tasks [superuser](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-3) [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-4). Input devices may not function correctly under this setting [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-4).\n*   **High:** Increasing the process level to high gives it extra CPU time and enhances performance [auslogics](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-5) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-1).\n*   **Above Normal:** This is a step above the default "Normal" priority [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-1).\n*   **Normal:** This is the default priority for most applications [auslogics](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-5) [superuser](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-2).\n*   **Below Normal:** This assigns less CPU time to the process [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-1).\n*   **Low:** This gives the process the lowest priority [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-1).\n\n**Best Practices and Considerations**\n\n*   **Prioritize selectively:** Only prioritize processes that genuinely require additional resources, such as resource-intensive applications or time-sensitive tasks [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0). Avoid unnecessarily prioritizing processes that don\'t require special treatment [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0).\n*   **Real-time priority:** Using real-time priority can make the computer slow [superuser](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-2). It is generally recommended to avoid this setting unless it is necessary [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-1).\n*   **Potential instability:** Setting CPU priority too high for an application can cause other processes to slow down [reasonlabs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-6). Finding a balance that works best for the computer is important [reasonlabs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-6).\n*   **Multi-core processors:** If a multi-core processor or a multi-processor system is available, affinity can be set for only one core [superuser](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-2). This way, the rest of the system will remain responsive while the high-priority process benefits [superuser](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-2).\n*   **Non-permanent:** Changes made through Task Manager are not permanent and will revert to normal after a reboot [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-1).\n\n**Priority Scheduling Algorithms**\n\nPriority scheduling is a common algorithm used by operating systems to schedule processes based on their priority [geeksforgeeks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-7). Each process is assigned a priority value based on criteria such as memory requirements, time requirements, and resource needs [geeksforgeeks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-7). The process with the highest priority is selected for execution first [geeksforgeeks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-7). Priority scheduling can be implemented in two ways:\n\n*   **Non-Preemptive:** Once a process starts executing, it runs until completion or until it voluntarily releases the CPU [geeksforgeeks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-7).\n*   **Preemptive:** If a higher-priority process arrives, the currently running process is interrupted and the CPU is switched to the higher-priority process [geeksforgeeks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-7).\n\n**CPU Scheduling and Gaming**\n\nThe development of sched-ext in Linux kernels allows for optimized CPU schedulers for specific use cases, such as gaming [steamcommunity](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-8). This maximizes the response time of game-related threads and reduces non-gaming tasks [steamcommunity](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-8).\n\n**Third-Party Tools**\n\nTools like NinjaOne RMM and Process Lasso offer advanced features for managing CPU priorities, including automation and persistent settings [bitsum](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-9) [ninjaone](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-0). Process Lasso\'s ProBalance algorithm dynamically adjusts process priorities to maintain system responsiveness during high CPU loads [bitsum](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/18-9).\n', 'Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on "fullscreen unredirect issues" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nFullscreen unredirect issues can manifest as performance reduction, screen tearing, and problems with VRR/G-Sync [launchpad](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-0) [gnome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-1) [gnome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-2).

These decorations use a visual with transparency, which can break unredirection if the root and application windows use different visuals [gnome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-2).\n*   **Visual Mismatches:** When a client window uses RGB visuals with an RGBA parent GTK frame window, Xwayland might take paths where the content of the two windows is blitted together, adding an extra copy operation [gnome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-2).\n*   **Driver-Agnostic Issue:** The problem is a fundamental driver-agnostic issue, although the exact effects can vary depending on the platform [gnome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-2).\n\n**Potential Solutions and Workarounds:**\n\n*   **Disable Unredirect Fullscreen Windows Extension:** A GNOME Shell extension is available to disable unredirect fullscreen windows, which can address the click-through bug and screen tearing [gnome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-3) [gnome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-1) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-9).\n*   **Meta.disable\\_unredirect\\_for\\_screen:** Use the command `Meta.disable_unredirect_for_screen(global.screen)` in GNOME\'s console (accessible via Alt+F2, then typing "lg") to disable unredirection [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-8).\n*   **VRR Configuration:** For AMD GPUs on X11, ensure VRR (FreeSync) is enabled in the `xorg.conf.d` configuration file [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-5).\n*   **Check for Fullscreen Recognition:** The issue might stem from GNOME not recognizing the application as truly fullscreen. The window needs to cover the entire xscreen [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-5).\n*   **Mutter Fixes:** Keep your Mutter version updated, as fixes are being developed to address unredirection issues [fedoraproject](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-7) [gnome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-2).\n*   **Disable Composition:** Fullscreen applications should bypass composition to take advantage of VRR [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-5).\n*   **Nvidia Driver Configuration:** Some users have found solutions involving Nvidia driver settings to eliminate tearing [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-8).\n\nIt\'s important to note that some older discussions suggest that "unredirect fullscreen windows" is enabled automatically when possible [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-6). However, more recent reports indicate that this is not always the case, and issues can arise that require manual intervention [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-5) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/19-6).\n', 'Okay, I will conduct Google Searches to gather the most recent information on "interrupt handling" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nInterrupt handling is a crucial aspect of modern computer systems that allows the CPU to respond efficiently to events requiring immediate attention [jumpcloud](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-0) [numberanalytics](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-1). It enables the CPU to temporarily suspend its current activity to handle higher-priority tasks triggered by hardware or software signals [numberanalytics](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-1) [rsinc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-2). This mechanism is fundamental for multitasking and ensures system responsiveness [jumpcloud](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-0).\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Interrupt:** A signal generated by hardware devices or software conditions indicating an event that requires immediate CPU attention [jumpcloud](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-0).\n*   **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The primary computer component that interprets and executes instructions while managing interrupt processing [jumpcloud](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-0).\n*   **Interrupt Handler (or Interrupt Service Routine - ISR):** A dedicated block of code that services a specific interrupt type, performing the necessary actions to respond to the triggering event [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-3) [jumpcloud](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/20-0).
