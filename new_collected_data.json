          "output": "The DeepSeek R1 671B model is a large language model (LLM) designed for reasoning, but its size presents deployment challenges. Quantization, a technique to reduce the model's memory footprint, is crucial for deploying it on more accessible hardware. Here's a breakdown of deploying DeepSeek R1 671B with INT4 quantization on L40s 48GB GPUs:\n\n**1. Hardware and Cost Considerations:**\n\n*   **High Infrastructure Requirements:** DeepSeek R1 and V3 are approximately 400GB in size, requiring substantial infrastructure.\n*   **Quantization Benefits:** Quantization reduces the model size; INT4 quantization can reduce the model size by 75%.\n*   **GPU Options:**\n    *   **High-end:** Running the full-scale model requires 8xA100 GPUs, costing $30,000 per month on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Even with quantization to 131GB, 2xH100 80GB GPUs are needed, costing $7,000 per month on GCP.\n    *   **Lower-cost:** A Hetzner setup with 512GB RAM + RTX 6000 Ada 48GB VRAM costs $1,000 per month, but performance is significantly slower.\n*   **Local Deployment:** Some users have run DeepSeek on 8 Mac Minis, costing $20,000, but performance was slow.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** DeepSeek proves that high-quality AI doesn't have to be expensive, and the cost of AI is dropping fast.\n\n**2. Quantization and Performance:**\n\n*   **INT4 Quantization:** Using INT4 quantization can reduce the memory cost of DeepSeek-R1's model weights to about 370GB, potentially supporting single-machine deployment.\n*   **Accuracy Trade-off:** INT4 quantization can cause more severe reasoning quality degradation and affects accuracy, especially in mathematical calculations, complex logical reasoning, and multi-step inference tasks.\n*   **Performance Recovery:** Quantized DeepSeek models retain strong performance, with 4-bit quantization results often comparable to FP8 in many scenarios.\n*   **Inference Speed:** Quantized reasoning LLMs perform strongly on challenging benchmarks while delivering substantial inference speedups.\n\n**3. Deployment Strategies and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Single-Machine Deployment:** Hosting the full version of DeepSeek-V3 or DeepSeek-R1 on a single machine is appealing due to its simplicity and relatively low cost.\n*   **Offloading Techniques:** Due to the large size of DeepSeek R1 and V3, offloading techniques using tools like Ollama can be employed. This involves storing part of the model in system RAM and dynamically shifting active layers to GPU VRAM.\n*   **Hardware for Offloading:** Even with offloading, a high-memory server is needed, such as one with 512GB of RAM and an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB VRAM) or a Hetzner's 512GB RAM + RTX 6000 Ada 48GB VRAM setup.\n*   **NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs:** A single NVIDIA DGX system with eight NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs can achieve over 250 tokens per second per user or a maximum throughput of over 30,000 tokens per second on the DeepSeek-R1 model.\n*   **Consumer Hardware:** While optimized for NVIDIA H800 GPUs, DeepSeek R1's efficient design lowers hardware requirements compared to GPT-4. Running on consumer GPUs is still challenging but more feasible with quantization and pruning.\n*   **Local Gaming Rig:** It is possible to achieve over 2 tokens/second without a GPU on a local gaming rig by using dynamic quantization and mmap() the model files off of a fast NVMe SSD.\n\n**4. Model Details and Capabilities:**\n\n*   **Reasoning Focus:** DeepSeek R1 is built for reasoning and uses inference-time scaling techniques, which may result in longer response times but more structured and logical answers.\n*   **MoE Architecture:** DeepSeek R1 has a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, activating only 37 billion parameters per token, which lowers computational costs and speeds up inference.\n*   **Context Window:** It can maintain context over 128,000 tokens, making it suitable for tasks involving lengthy documents.\n*   **Distilled Models:** DeepSeek-R1 distilled models are fine-tuned versions of open-source models, inheriting DeepSeek's reasoning capabilities while being more efficient to self-host.\n\n**5. Potential Issues:**\n\n*   **\"Reduced Intelligence\":** Many domestic AI accelerator card DeepSeek deployments suffer from \"reduced intelligence\" issues.\n*   **Quantization Errors:** Quantization errors can affect inference accuracy, especially in mathematical calculations, complex logical reasoning, and multi-step inference tasks, potentially degrading performance.\n\nIn summary, deploying DeepSeek R1 671B with INT4 quantization on L40s 48GB GPUs is possible but requires careful consideration of hardware requirements, cost, and the trade-offs between memory usage and accuracy. While quantization enables deployment on less powerful hardware, it's essential to evaluate the impact on performance and ensure it meets the specific requirements of the intended application.\n"

          "output": "It appears the user is asking about the DeepSeek R1 671B model, specifically regarding concurrent users when running the int4 quantized version on L40s GPUs. Here's a summary of what the search results provide:\n\n**DeepSeek R1 671B Overview:**\n\n*   **Architecture:** DeepSeek R1 utilizes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. It has a total of 671 billion parameters, with 37 billion activated per token. It supports a context length of 128K tokens.\n*   **Performance:** DeepSeek R1 demonstrates performance comparable to OpenAI's models in math, code, and reasoning tasks. It achieves high scores in benchmarks like MATH-500 (97.3%), Codeforces (96.3% percentile), and AIME 2024 (79.8%).\n*   **Inference Speed:** On a single NVIDIA DGX system with eight NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, DeepSeek-R1 671B can achieve over 250 tokens per second per user, or a maximum throughput of over 30,000 tokens per second. On a single NVIDIA HGX H200 system, the DeepSeek-R1 NIM microservice can deliver up to 3,872 tokens per second.\n*   **Quantization:** DeepSeek uses native FP8 for training and inference. For GPUs that do not support FP8, the model can be converted to BF16, though this doubles the memory usage. Quantization to INT4 reduces memory usage but can impact accuracy.\n*   **Hardware Requirements:** Running the full DeepSeek-R1 671B model requires substantial resources. A multi-GPU setup with a minimum of 16x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs is recommended. VRAM requirements are approximately 1,500+ GB without quantization.\n\n**DeepSeek R1 671B int4 on L40s:**\n\n*   One source mentions running DeepSeek R1 671B on 4 nodes of L40S GPUs, with 8 GPUs per node. However, this source discusses a bug related to FlashMLA and doesn't provide specific details on concurrent users or performance.\n*   L40S GPUs are mentioned as suitable for DeepSeek inference, but primarily in the context of comparing them to other GPUs with FP8 support.\n*   It is possible to run a Q4_K_M version of DeepSeek-Coder-V3/R1 671B with 14GB VRAM and 382GB DRAM using KTransformers.\n\n**Concurrent User Capacity:**\n\n*   The number of concurrent users depends heavily on the hardware configuration, context length, and desired token generation speed.\n*   A single NVIDIA DGX system with eight NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs can achieve over 250 tokens per second *per user*.\n*   One user reported experimenting with up to 8 concurrent slots inferencing on a gaming rig with 96GB RAM + 24GB VRAM, achieving 1~2 tokens/sec with a 2k~16k context using a dynamic quant.\n*   A mid-range deployment with an NVIDIA RTX A6000 (48GB VRAM) running DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B achieved 1,600 tokens/second with 50 concurrent requests and 2,865 tokens/second with 100 concurrent requests.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Memory Capacity (VRAM):** Insufficient memory can prevent models from loading or cause low operational efficiency.\n*   **SSD Wear:** Frequent writes (e.g., swapping layers) could degrade SSD lifespan over years of heavy use, but this is negligible for most users.\n*   **Thermals:** Sustained high token generation rates may push the thermal limits of the hardware.\n*   **Quantization:** While quantization reduces memory footprint, it can also impact accuracy, especially in tasks requiring mathematical calculations or complex reasoning.\n\n**In summary:** While the search results confirm that DeepSeek R1 671B can run on L40s GPUs, a precise number for concurrent users for an int4 quantized version isn't explicitly stated. The concurrent user capacity will depend on the specific hardware configuration (number of GPUs, memory, etc.), the context length being used, and the acceptable token generation speed for the application.\n"

However, the search results provide valuable insights for estimating and optimizing such a deployment.\n\n**Memory Capacity and Model Size:**\n\n*   The DeepSeek R1 671B model is a large Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It has 671 billion parameters, with 37 billion activated per token.\n*   The full DeepSeek-R1 (671B) model requires substantial VRAM, approximately 1,500+ GB without quantization.

It also provides ~864 GB/s memory bandwidth.\n\n**Estimating Concurrent Users:**\n\n1.  **Quantization:** Using INT4 quantization is crucial to fit the model within the available VRAM of the 8 L40s GPUs.\n2.  **Memory Considerations:** Even with INT4 quantization, the model might require more than the combined 384GB VRAM (8 GPUs x 48GB). Techniques like CPU offloading or model parallelism might be necessary.\n3.  **Throughput per User:** Assuming a minimum generation speed of 10 tokens/second per user, the system needs to deliver at least that many tokens per second for each concurrent user.\n4.  **Scaling from H100/H200:** Given that 8x H100 GPUs (with INT4) can achieve ~2,500 tokens/second and 8x H200 GPUs can achieve ~3,800 tokens/second, we can estimate the L40s performance. The L40S has less compute power and memory bandwidth than H100/H200.\n5.  **Estimating L40s Performance:** A rough estimate, considering the L40S specifications, might place the 8x L40s system at around 1,500 to 2,500 tokens/second.\n6.  **Concurrent User Calculation:** Based on the estimated throughput of 1,500 to 2,500 tokens/second and a requirement of 10 tokens/second per user, the system might support **150 to 250 concurrent users**.\n\n**Memory Management Techniques and Configurations:**\n\n*   **Quantization:** Using INT4 or even lower precision quantization (like 1.5-bit dynamic quantization) is essential to reduce the memory footprint.\n*   **Inference Optimization Frameworks:** Using frameworks like vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, or SGLang can significantly improve inference performance. vLLM optimizes attention computation and manages the KV cache efficiently.\n*   **Tensor Parallelism:** Splitting the model across multiple GPUs for efficient memory utilization and computation.\n*   **CPU Offloading:** Offloading some layers or computations to the CPU if the GPU memory is insufficient.\n*   **Paged Attention:** Efficient management of the KV cache.\n*   **Continuous Batching:** Processing multiple requests in parallel to improve throughput.\n\n**Potential Bottlenecks and Optimizations:**\n\n*   **Memory Bandwidth:** Insufficient memory bandwidth can become a bottleneck when inferencing large models across multiple GPUs.\n*   **Inter-GPU Communication:** High-speed interconnects (like NVLink) are crucial for efficient parameter synchronization and KV cache sharing between GPUs.\n*   **Attention Mechanism:** Optimizing attention computation (e.g., using FlashAttention) can lead to faster inference.\n*   **FP8 Support:** Using FP8 precision, if supported, can improve computational efficiency and inference accuracy.\n*   **Model Distillation:** Consider using distilled versions of DeepSeek-R1, which have reduced parameter counts and lower hardware requirements.\n*   **Load Balancing:** For MoE models, efficient load balancing across experts is crucial.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThe estimated number of concurrent users (150-250) is a rough approximation.

These reactions are essential in various fields, including energy production, environmental science, biology, and industrial processes.\n\n**General Principles:**\n\n*   **Oxidation:** Loss of electron(s) by a species, resulting in an increase in oxidation number.\n*   **Reduction:** Gain of electron(s) by a species, resulting in a decrease in oxidation number.\n*   **Redox Reaction:** A reaction where both oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously.\n*   **Oxidizing Agent (Oxidant):** A substance that accepts electrons and causes oxidation in another species; it is itself reduced.\n*   **Reducing Agent (Reductant):** A substance that donates electrons and causes reduction in another species; it is itself oxidized.\n\n**Acid-Base and Redox Reactions**\n\nAcid-base reactions involve the transfer of protons, while redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons. In some instances, reactions involving metals and acids can be classified as both neutralization and redox reactions. For example, the reaction between a metal and an acid produces a salt and hydrogen gas.\n\n**Formation of Oxide Salt Acids**\n\nWhile the search results don't explicitly detail a single-step \"redox reaction yielding oxide salt acid,\" they provide information that can be synthesized to understand how such a process might occur:\n\n1.  **Oxidation of an Element to an Acidic Oxide:** An element can be oxidized in the air to generate its acidic oxide. For example, the oxidation of sulfur yields sulfur dioxide (SO2), an acidic oxide.\n\n2.  **Formation of Oxo-acids or Oxo-salts:** Acidic oxides can react with water to form oxoacids or with basic oxides to form oxo-salts.\n\n3.  **Redox Reactions in Acid Formation:** Cold atmospheric pressure plasma can induce oxidation of water-soluble compounds. The major product of nitrogen oxidation in these reactions is HNO3.\n\n**Examples of Redox Reactions**\n\n*   **Reactions of Metals with Acids:** Metals react with acids to form salts and hydrogen gas. For example, Zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid to form zinc chloride and hydrogen.\n*   **Formation of Oxides:** The reaction of a metal with oxygen to form an oxide is a redox reaction where the metal is oxidized, and oxygen is reduced.\n*   **Combustion Reactions:** The burning of organic compounds in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water is a redox reaction.\n*   **Reactions with Metal Oxides:** When an acid reacts with a metal oxide, a salt and water are formed.\n*   **Displacement Reactions:** Metals undergo displacement reactions with acids to form salts and hydrogen gas.\n\n**Redox Reactions and the Synthesis of Oxo Anions**\n\nThe synthesis of a salt of an oxo anion with a highly oxidized central atom is typically carried out in a basic solution. Oxidizing agents like chlorine or hydrogen peroxide can be used in alkaline solutions.

          "output": "A redox reaction that forms an oxide salt acid involves both reduction and oxidation processes. Here's a breakdown of the conditions and factors that influence such reactions:\n\n**1. Basic Principles of Redox Reactions**\n\n*   **Redox Definition**: Redox reactions involve changes in the oxidation number of interacting species. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, while reduction is the gain of electrons.\n*   **Simultaneous Processes**: Oxidation and reduction always occur together. One substance loses electrons (oxidation) while another gains electrons (reduction).\n*   **Redox Agents**: Oxidizing agents accept electrons and are reduced, while reducing agents donate electrons and are oxidized.\n\n**2. Formation of Oxide Salt Acids**\n\n*   **Acidic Oxides**: Acidic oxides can react with water to form oxoacids or with basic oxides to form oxo salts.\n*   **Synthesis in Basic Solutions**: The synthesis of oxo anion salts with highly oxidized central atoms is typically performed in basic solutions.\n*   **Oxidizing Agents in Basic Solutions**: When oxidations are carried out in basic solutions, oxidizing agents like chlorine are preferred because they involve few or no hydrogen ions during reduction.\n\n**3. Key Conditions and Factors**\n\n*   **Reduction Potential**: If the desired oxo acid or anion has a reduction potential below approximately +0.2V, acid-base reactions may suffice, as the element might naturally exist in the desired oxidation state.\n*   **Strongly Basic Solutions and Oxidizing Agents**: For species with standard reduction potentials greater than +1.2 V in acidic solution, strong oxidizing agents and strongly basic solutions are required.\n*   **Concentration Dependence**: The potential for oxoanions, oxoacids, oxides, and hydroxides is more complex than for simple metal cations, and is dependent on concentration. Decreasing hydrogen ion concentration favors the stability of ferrate in strongly basic solutions.\n*   **Electrolysis**: Many oxo anions can be prepared through the electrolysis of aqueous solutions containing elements in low oxidation states. This process reduces water at the cathode, generating hydroxide ions and lowering the pH, while the oxo anion is produced at the anode.\n*   **Oxidizing Acids**: If the oxo anion has a standard reduction potential between +0.3 and +1.2 V, basic conditions may not be necessary, and strongly oxidizing acids like nitric acid can be used.\n*   **Oxidation in Air**: Elements can be oxidized in the air to generate their acidic oxides.\n\n**4. Periodic Trends**\n\n*   **p-Block Elements**: For oxo anions and acids of p-block elements in their highest oxidation state, the stability decreases across a period, and the ability to act as an oxidizing agent increases.\n*   **Group Stability**: The group oxidation number is least stable at the top (second period) and bottom (sixth period) of a family, and most stable in the third period.\n*   **d-Block Elements**: In d-block elements, Period 4 elements show the greatest reluctance to adopt the group oxidation number.\n\n**5. Reactions with Metals**\n\n*   **Acid + Metal -> Salt + Hydrogen**: Acids react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and a salt. For example: H2SO4 + Mg -> MgSO4 + H2.\n*   **Redox Reaction**: The reaction between acids and metals is a redox reaction where the metal is oxidized (loses electrons) and hydrogen is reduced (gains electrons).\n\n**6. Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Non-Standard Conditions**: Most redox reactions occur under nonstandard conditions, where changes in reactant and product concentrations alter the driving force of the reaction.\n*   **Nernst Equation**: The Nernst equation describes the effect of nonstandard concentrations on potential at room temperature.\n*   **Role of Water**: Water can act as both an oxidizing and reducing agent, influencing the redox process.\n\nBy understanding these conditions and factors, one can better control and predict the formation of oxide salt acids in redox reactions.\n"

          "output": "It's challenging to pinpoint a single redox reaction that *definitively* produces an oxide, a salt, and an acid as *sole* products from readily available lab reactants. However, here's a breakdown of relevant redox concepts and examples that get close to the request, or illustrate the principles involved:\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Redox Reactions:** These reactions involve the transfer of electrons between chemical species, leading to changes in oxidation states. Oxidation is the loss of electrons; reduction is the gain of electrons. Oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously.\n*   **Oxidizing and Reducing Agents:** The oxidizing agent gains electrons and is reduced, while the reducing agent loses electrons and is oxidized.\n*   **Oxidation Number:** This number indicates the hypothetical charge of an atom if all bonds were ionic. Changes in oxidation number identify redox reactions.\n\n**Examples & Discussion**\n\n1.  **Metal + Acid Reactions:**\n\n    *   Many metals react with acids to form a salt and hydrogen gas.\n    *   *Example:* Ca(s) + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) → CaSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)\n    *   In this reaction, calcium is oxidized, and hydrogen is reduced. While this produces a salt (calcium sulfate) and a gas (hydrogen), it doesn't directly yield an oxide.\n    *   The general form is: Metal + Acid → Salt + Hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Redox Reactions with Nitric Acid:**\n\n    *   Copper metal reacts with nitric acid.\n    *   *Example:* Copper is oxidized by nitric acid to form copper nitrate, water, and NO<sub>2</sub> gas.\n    *   The copper nitrate dissociates into copper(2+) and nitrate ions in water.\n    *   Adding a base to the mixture can form copper(II) hydroxide precipitate. Upon heating, copper(II) hydroxide decomposes into copper oxide (CuO) and water.\n    *   *Note:* This multi-step reaction *does* produce an oxide (CuO) and a salt (copper nitrate), but it also involves the formation of a gas (NO<sub>2</sub>) and requires a base (like NaOH) in a later step to form the hydroxide intermediate.\n\n3.  **Reactions Forming Oxides:**\n\n    *   Metals and nonmetals react with oxygen to form oxides.\n    *   *Example:* 2Mg(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2MgO(s)\n    *   However, this doesn't directly produce a salt and an acid.\n\n4.  **Reactions with Halogens:**\n\n    *   Hydrogen and fluorine react to produce hydrofluoric acid: H<sub>2</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> → 2 HF. This is a redox reaction.\n    *   However, this doesn't produce an oxide or a salt.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations**\n\n*   **Direct Single-Step Reactions:** It's difficult to find a single-step redox reaction with common lab reactants that *exclusively* produces an oxide, a salt, and an acid. Many reactions produce multiple products, or require specific conditions or catalysts to favor certain outcomes.\n*   **Multi-Step Processes:** It may be possible to achieve the desired products through a series of sequential reactions. For example, a metal could be oxidized to form a metal oxide, which then reacts with an acid to form a salt and water.\n*   **Balancing Equations:** When considering redox reactions, it's crucial to balance the equations to ensure that the number of atoms and charges are equal on both sides. Half-reactions (oxidation and reduction) can be balanced separately and then combined.\n"

          "output": "While the idea of directly consuming rocks for mineral intake might seem unusual, certain minerals derived from rocks are indeed essential for human health. However, it's crucial to distinguish between safe and harmful minerals and to understand the potential risks involved.\n\n**Beneficial Minerals from Rocks and Their Uses**\n\n*   **Calcium:** Derived from calcite (calcium carbonate), found in limestone and marble, calcium is vital for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth, supporting muscle function, nerve signaling, and blood clotting. Gypsum (calcium sulfate) is another source of calcium used in some cheeses, ice cream, and canned vegetables.\n*   **Magnesium:** This mineral is essential for muscle and nerve function, blood glucose management, energy production, and DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. It can be sourced from minerals like magnesite.\n*   **Potassium:** Important for regulating fluid balance, muscle contractions, nerve signals, and maintaining proper heart function. Sylvite (KCl) can be used as a salt substitute to increase potassium intake.\n*   **Iron:** Crucial for forming hemoglobin, which carries oxygen to the cells. Iron-fortified cereals are a common source.\n*   **Zinc:** Helps the body make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrates, fat, and protein, and aids in wound healing.\n*   **Selenium:** Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage, and is important for thyroid function and immune system support.\n*   **Iodine:** Essential for thyroidal hormones, temperature control, body growth, and reproduction. As iodine is a trace element found mainly in seawater, rocks and some soils, good food sources include: fish and shellfish; some vegetables and grains.\n*   **Silica (Silicon Dioxide):** A major component of rocks like granite, sand, and quartz. It's found in many foods and is taken as a dietary supplement to strengthen bones and support hair, skin, and nail health.\n*   **Fluoride:** Derived from fluorite, fluoride is used to keep teeth strong and healthy.\n*   **Electrolytes:** Sodium, potassium, and chloride, sourced from minerals, maintain water balance and pressure between cells and fluids.\n*   **Trace Minerals:** Many trace minerals, including chromium, copper, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and others, are essential for various bodily functions. Colloidal minerals derived from shale deposits contain many trace minerals, including boron, calcium, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, silver, sodium, sulfur, tin, & zinc.\n\n**Potential Risks and Toxicity**\n\n*   **Toxic Minerals:** Some minerals are inherently toxic. Examples include:\n    *   **Chalcanthite:** A water-soluble copper sulfate that can cause copper poisoning.\n    *   **Stibnite:** A toxic antimony sulfide.\n    *   **Asbestos:** Inhaling asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.\n    *   **Arsenopyrite and Orpiment:** Arsenic sulfide minerals that can lead to arsenic poisoning.\n    *   **Cinnabar:** A mercury sulfide mineral that can release toxic mercury.\n    *   **Galena:** A lead sulfide mineral.\n    *   **Hutchinsonite:** Contains thallium, lead, and arsenic, making it extremely dangerous.\n    *   **Torbernite:** A radioactive mineral containing uranium that releases radon and can cause lung cancer.\n*   **Heavy Metal Contamination:** Clays and soils consumed through geophagy may be contaminated with toxic metals like lead, nickel, cadmium, chromium, copper, and mercury.\n*   **Mineral Imbalance:** Excessive intake of certain minerals can disrupt the balance in the body and lead to toxicity. For example, too much fluoride can cause fluorosis, making teeth and bones brittle.\n*   **Interference with Nutrient Absorption:** Geophagic substances, particularly those rich in clay minerals, can bind to nutrients and beneficial pharmaceuticals in the gut, reducing their bioavailability.\n*   **Industrial Processing:** Minerals in supplements are often industrial chemicals processed from rocks with acids, which may pose toxicity concerns.\n*   **Radioactivity:** Radioactive substances like uranium and polonium are common poisons.\n\n**Geophagy: Eating Earth**\n\nGeophagy, the practice of consuming earth or soil-like substances, is observed in animals and humans.

      "ai_message": "Nata de coco and bacterial cellulose are closely related but not entirely the same. Nata de coco is a specific type of bacterial cellulose produced by *Komagataeibacter xylinus* (formerly *Acetobacter xylinum*) during the fermentation of coconut water [souschef](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [nawon](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). Both are primarily composed of cellulose [souschef](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [rjpbcs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7), but bacterial cellulose, in general, can be produced from various sources, including organic waste, and is considered a purer form of cellulose, lacking lignin and hemicellulose found in plant-derived cellulose [preprints](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8) [rsc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4) [mdpi](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [rjpbcs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7). Nata de coco undergoes additional processing steps like washing, cutting, and sweetening for food applications [souschef](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n\nRegarding the fiber scale, bacterial cellulose is known for its unique 3D nanofibril network [lodz](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9). The fibers typically range from 20 to 100 nm in diameter [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [acs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4), with some reports indicating even finer fibrils with a cross-sectional thickness of 6-10 nm [rsc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). These nanofibers can assemble into fiber bundles with a thickness of 40-60 nm [rsc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4). While bacterial cellulose exhibits a nanofibril structure, nata de coco, being a specific form of bacterial cellulose, also consists of cellulose nanofibers, accounting for approximately 99% of its structure [sciencedaily](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0). These nanofibers in nata de coco are around 20 nm in width [biokoko](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). The discrepancy between the nanoscale fibers described in the literature and your microscale observations could arise from several factors. While individual nanofibers are nanoscale, they tend to aggregate into larger microscale structures [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n\nProcessing methods can significantly influence the observed fiber size. For instance, high-pressure homogenization can reduce fiber diameter from microscale to nanoscale [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8). Conversely, the absence of such processing or the presence of aggregation-inducing steps could result in larger, microscale fibers. Additionally, longer culture durations can produce larger BC particles with thicker cellulose fibers [rsc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n\nThe limitations of your microscopy setup could also explain the absence of observable nanoscale fibers. Standard optical microscopes typically have a resolution limit of around 200 nm, making it difficult to resolve individual nanofibers smaller than this size. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are commonly used to observe the morphology of nata de coco and its fibers at higher resolutions [mdpi](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3) [umj](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4) [rjpbcs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5) [oup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6) [ukm](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7) [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-8) [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-9) [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-10) [core](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-11). If you are using optical microscopy, you may only be observing the larger aggregates of nanofibers. Sample preparation techniques for microscopy, such as drying, can also affect the observed fiber size and morphology [oup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6) [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-10).",

Composition:**\n\n*   **Nata de Coco:** Primarily composed of carbohydrates and water. It's a jelly-like substance made from the microbial cellulose produced by *Acetobacter xylinum* (now known as *Komagataeibacter xylinus*) during the fermentation of coconut water. Nata de coco is mainly cellulose, a form of insoluble fiber.\n*   **Bacterial Cellulose (BC):** A pure form of cellulose, free from lignin and hemicellulose, which are found in plant-derived cellulose. It consists of glucose monomers.\n\n**2. Structure:**\n\n*   **Nata de Coco:** Has a chewy, translucent, jelly-like structure. The *Acetobacter xylinum* bacteria convert sugars in coconut water into a cellulose mat.\n*   **Bacterial Cellulose:** Possesses a unique 3D nanofibril network. It exhibits high crystallinity. BC fibers have a well-developed ultra-fine network structure, formed by ultrafine fibers with a diameter of 3-4 nm combined into fiber bundles with a thickness of 40-60 nm, and then interweaving with each other.\n\n**3. Production:**\n\n*   **Nata de Coco:** Produced by fermenting coconut water with *Acetobacter xylinum*. The process involves sterilizing a nutrient-rich medium (usually coconut water), inoculating it with the bacteria, and allowing fermentation to occur at a controlled temperature (26-30°C) for 7-14 days. The bacteria consume sugars and produce a gelatinous cellulose mat on the surface. The cellulose mat is then harvested, washed, cut, and often sweetened.\n*   **Bacterial Cellulose:** Can be produced through static or agitated methods. Static cultivation yields high-quality cellulose films but has lower yields and longer incubation times. Agitated cultivation accelerates production but may affect fiber uniformity. BC can also be produced using CO2 as a sole carbon source. Some researchers are modifying bacteria to produce more cellulose.\n\n**4. Differences:**\n\n*   **Source:** Nata de coco is specifically derived from the fermentation of coconut water, while bacterial cellulose can be produced from various sources, including organic waste.\n*   **Purity:** Bacterial cellulose is generally considered purer than plant-derived cellulose because it lacks lignin and hemicellulose.\n*   **Processing:** Nata de coco production involves additional steps like washing, cutting, and sweetening, which are not always required for bacterial cellulose intended for other applications.\n*   **Structure:** While both are forms of microbial cellulose, bacterial cellulose often exhibits a more defined nanofibril structure and higher crystallinity compared to the cellulose in nata de coco.\n*   **Properties:** Bacterial cellulose generally has higher mechanical strength, elasticity, and water-holding capacity compared to nata de coco.\n*   **Applications:** Nata de coco is primarily used as a food ingredient, while bacterial cellulose has a wider range of applications, including biomedical, textiles, cosmetics, and packaging.\n\n**5. Production Details of Nata De Coco:**\n\n*   **Ingredients:** Coconut water, refined sugar, ammonium phosphate, acetic acid, and a nata starter.\n*   **Process:**\n    *   Filter coconut water.\n    *   Mix coconut water with refined sugar and ammonium phosphate.\n    *   Boil the mixture, cool it, and add glacial acetic acid.\n    *   Add the nata starter.\n    *   Allow the mixture to ferment for 1-2 weeks.\n    *   Harvest the nata, rinse, and store in coconut water.\n*   **Key factors for successful production:** Use fresh coconut water, maintain cleanliness, control temperature (25-30°C), and ensure proper ventilation.\n\n**6. Key Properties of Bacterial Cellulose:**\n\n*   High purity.\n*   High water retention capacity.\n*   Biocompatibility.\n*   Biodegradability.\n*   Strong mechanical properties.\n*   High thermal stability.\n*   High degree of crystallinity.\n*   Non-toxic and non-allergenic.\n\n**7. Applications of Bacterial Cellulose:**\n\n*   **Medical:** Wound healing, tissue engineering, drug delivery, artificial skin, blood vessels.\n*   **Textiles:** Replacing synthetic fibers, reinforcing material in fabrics, smart textiles.\n*   **Food Packaging:** Sustainable and biodegradable packaging.\n*   **Cosmetics:** Natural and organic beauty products.\n*   **Electronics:** Electronic paper, audio membranes.\n"

These nanofibers form a 3D network.\n*   Bio Nanocellulose fibers in nata de coco measure around 20 nanometers in width, which is significantly thinner than human hair.\n*   These intertwined nanofibers exhibit high strength and can retain water up to 100 times their dry weight.\n*   The cellulose chains in nata de coco nanofibers are straight at the molecular level, which is helpful for determining the intrinsic birefringence of the material.\n\n**Microscopy and Observation:**\n\n*   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is commonly used to observe the morphology of nata de coco and its fibers. SEM analysis can reveal the fibrous structure and particle sizes of bacterial cellulose.\n*   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also used to assess the ultrastructural characteristics of cells interacting with nata de coco-derived materials.\n*   For SEM, samples often require preparation steps such as fixation with glutaraldehyde, dehydration using ethanol, and drying.\n*   In SEM analysis, the fiber diameter of Nata de Coco was significantly smaller than that of natural cotton linter.\n*   SEM analysis showed that the resulting fibrous particles had not uniform in size and shapes.\n\n**Processing and Fiber Modification:**\n\n*   Oxidized cellulose (OC) nanofibers can be prepared from nata de coco using a mixture of HNO3/H3PO4 – NaNO2. The resulting OC products exhibit a nanofibrous structure with diameters around 58.3–65.4 nm.\n*   The diameter size of the oxidized cellulose decreases with an increase in the reaction time due to the hydrolysis of the raw material by strong acid.\n*   Nata de coco bacterial cellulose can be converted into cellulose nanofibers (CNF) using a high shear mixer (HSM), retaining its fibrous structure with nanometer-scale widths.\n*   Carboxymethyl bacterial cellulose can be derived from nata de coco through carboxymethylation using NaOH and monochloroacetic acid.\n\n**Limitations and Challenges:**\n\n*   While SEM is useful, the resulting fibrous particles are not uniform in size and shape.\n*   The distribution of cells within a nata de coco matrix can be heterogeneous, leading to variability in cell density measurements.\n*   Some studies have encountered challenges in retaining myoblast cells within nata de coco scaffolds, indicating a need for alterations to the material's properties.\n*   Achieving optimal pore size in nata de coco scaffolds is crucial for cell growth and differentiation, requiring a balance between nutrient exchange and cell binding.\n*   Drying methods affect the properties of nata de coco, with freeze-drying resulting in the highest crystallinity and tensile strength compared to oven and tray drying.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n*   Nata de coco-derived nanocellulose has potential applications in food, medicine, cosmetics, tissue engineering, optical displays, and as a biosaffold for cell-based meat.\n*   It can be used for thickening, gelation, stabilization, water retention, and as a packaging material in the food industry.\n*   Modified bacterial cellulose from nata de coco can be used for wound dressings and tissue scaffolding.\n*   Nata de coco-derived CNF films can be used as thermally conductive materials with potential for thermal diffusivity modulation.\n\nThis information should provide a solid overview of the current state of research regarding nata de coco processing, microscopy, and nanoscale fiber observation.\n"

It specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an AIMS within organizations. It aims to ensure the responsible development and use of AI systems by addressing ethical considerations, transparency, and continuous learning. Certification to ISO 42001 demonstrates that an independent third party has validated an organization's framework for managing AI-related risks and opportunities.\n*   **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF):** Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), this framework helps organizations identify, assess, manage, and minimize risks associated with AI systems. It is a voluntary, non-regulatory guide that is adaptable across various industries. The AI RMF emphasizes a risk-based approach, encouraging continuous monitoring and iterative improvement. It focuses on key functions: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.\n\n**Core Principles and Characteristics of Trustworthy AI:**\n\nSeveral sources emphasize key principles that underpin trustworthy AI:\n\n*   **Fairness:** AI systems and datasets must not systematically disadvantage individual groups.\n*   **Robustness:** AI systems must function reliably even under adverse conditions, such as noisy input data or adversarial attacks.\n*   **Integrity:** AI models and datasets must not be unknowingly tampered with; changes have to be traceable and verifiable.\n*   **Explainability:** Models must make decisions as transparent as possible for developers, users, and regulators.\n*   **Safety:** The protection of sensitive data and access to models must be guaranteed, and data breaches avoided.\n*   **Transparency:** Providing access to appropriate levels of information about an AI system and its outputs.\n*   **Accountability:** Establishing clear accountability and oversight structures for AI systems.\n*   **Security and Resilience:** Protecting AI systems from cyberattacks and ensuring they can withstand disruptions.\n*   **Privacy:** Safeguarding human autonomy, identity, and dignity by addressing freedom from intrusion and limiting observation.\n\n**Key Metrics and Evaluation Methods:**\n\n*   **Quantitative Metrics:** These include accuracy, which is the proportion of correct predictions. However, it's important not to over-optimize for a narrow score and lose sight of holistic quality. Performance metrics include Tokens per Second (TPS), Time to First Token (TTFT), Latency and Concurrency (Requests per Second) (RPS). Cost evaluations include GPU/CPU utilization and cost per 1K tokens.\n*   **Qualitative Assessment:** Subjective reviews help evaluate appropriateness, tone, or creativity, but they're harder to standardize.\n*   **FRIES Trust Score:** This score assesses risks across five pillars of trust: fairness, robustness, integrity, explainability, and safety. Risks are assessed with values for occurrence (O), severity (S), and detectability (D), scored from 0 to 10.\n*   **System vs. Model Evaluations:** Model evaluation focuses on the raw capabilities of an LLM in isolation, while system evaluation includes everything that wraps around the LLM, such as vector databases, APIs, and guardrails.\n*   **New Benchmarks:** HELM Safety, AIR-Bench, and FACTS are emerging tools for assessing factuality and safety.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Trade-offs:** Achieving trustworthiness involves navigating trade-offs between competing metrics, such as fairness versus efficiency or privacy versus transparency.\n*   **Benchmark Limitations:** Some benchmarks may have limitations, such as \"misspecified benchmarks\" that inflate confidence in robustness to spurious correlations.\n*   **Evolving Risks:** As AI technologies evolve, so do the risks, requiring continuous monitoring and adaptation of risk management strategies.\n*   **Standardized RAI Evaluations:** Standardized Responsible AI (RAI) evaluations remain rare among major industrial model developers, despite rising AI-related incidents.\n*   **Gaming of Benchmarks:** There are concerns about misaligned incentives and the gaming of benchmark results.\n\n**Trends and Future Directions:**\n\n*   **Increased Focus on AI Governance:** Enterprises are expected to place a heightened focus on strong AI governance, with an emphasis on ethical issues and data use.\n*   **Global Cooperation:** Global cooperation on AI governance is intensifying, with organizations releasing frameworks focused on transparency, trustworthiness, and other core responsible AI principles.\n*   **AI Evaluations Industry:** The AI evaluations industry is expected to play a critical role in ensuring that reliance on AI systems is safe and compatible with legal frameworks and ethical norms.\n*   **Use AI to Evaluate AI:** The possibility of using AI to evaluate AI, especially for scalability and speed, may emerge, but the trustworthiness of the evaluators must be ensured.\n"

          "output": "The Chatbot Arena, developed by researchers at LMSYS Org, is an open-source platform designed for evaluating AI through human preference. It uses the Bradley-Terry model to generate live leaderboards that rank AI chatbots and LLMs based on user votes. With over 3 million votes collected, the platform offers a comprehensive ranking system that is continuously updated.\n\n**Bradley-Terry Model Implementation:**\n\nThe Bradley-Terry model is implemented in the Chatbot Arena to statistically infer the strength of each model based on pairwise comparisons. Users interact with two anonymous models and vote for the better one, and these votes are then used to update the rankings. The model assumes that the performance of the players (LLMs) does not change over time, making the ratings less dependent on the order of the comparisons and more stable.\n\nThe Bradley-Terry model calculates model ratings using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), maximizing the likelihood of observed game outcomes given the model ratings. The probability of model B beating model A is expressed as: P(B beats A) = σ(x^Tθ*), where σ is the sigmoid function, x is a feature vector, and θ* is an unknown parameter vector. This parameter vector is the solution to a logistic regression problem. The coefficients are typically multiplied by 400 and added to 1000 to align with the Elo rating scale, though this transformation is cosmetic and does not affect the model's predictions.\n\nLMSYS has also developed extensions to the Bradley-Terry model to account for subsystems within each player that contribute to their strength, with both batch and online forms of these extensions.\n\n**Advantages over the Elo Rating System:**\n\nThe Chatbot Arena transitioned from the Elo rating system to the Bradley-Terry model because the latter provides more stable ratings and precise confidence intervals. The key advantages of the Bradley-Terry model in this context are:\n\n*   **Stability:** The Bradley-Terry model assumes that the performance of the models remains constant, which is suitable for the Chatbot Arena since most models are static, and their performance is not expected to change significantly. In contrast, the Elo rating system assumes that a player's performance changes over time, weighing recent games more heavily.\n*   **Confidence Intervals:** The Bradley-Terry model allows for better capture of the variance in model performance estimates through bootstrap confidence intervals.\n*   **Statistical Inference:** The Bradley-Terry model is better suited for statistical inference on model strength.\n\nWhile the Elo rating system is useful for tracking how LLMs perform over time, the Bradley-Terry model offers a more detailed look at how well each LLM performs by considering the difficulty of the tasks. The Bradley-Terry model provides more stable and reliable rankings for the Chatbot Arena, making it a preferred choice for evaluating and comparing LLMs based on human preferences.\n"

This file is typically located in `%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\My Games\\Deadlight\\`.\n*   In `LOTDEngine.ini`, change `bSmoothFrameRate` to `FALSE` or increase the `MaxSmoothedFrameRate` value to your monitor's refresh rate (e.g., 120 or 144).\n\n**3. Stuttering and Lag:**\n\n*   **Outdated information:** Some older forum posts (2013) mention lag issues, suggesting ensuring the game uses the dedicated graphics card on laptops.\n*   **Potential Causes:** Streaming assets can cause inconsistencies. An older CPU might exacerbate streaming issues.\n*   **Solutions to try:**\n    *   Close unnecessary background programs to reduce FPS drops, especially on low-end PCs.\n    *   Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date.\n    *   Adjust image settings in your graphics control panel (Nvidia or AMD). Try setting the preference to \"Performance\".\n    *   Set the game's priority to \"High\" or \"Above Normal\" in Task Manager.\n    *   Configure Storage Sense to automatically delete temporary files.\n    *   Ensure the display resolution matches the in-game resolution.\n    *   Try running the game in borderless fullscreen mode with VSync off and an uncapped frame rate.\n*   **INI Tweaks:**\n    *   In `LOTDEngine.ini`, try changing `bInitializeShadersOnDemand` to `TRUE`.\n\n**4. Other potential fixes/modifications:**\n\n*   **Anti-Aliasing:** The game doesn't natively support anti-aliasing. You can force it through Nvidia Profile Inspector.\n*   **Borderless Fullscreen:** Use GeDoSaTo with `forceBorderlessFullscreen 1`.\n*   **Skip Intro Videos:** Delete or rename the splash screen files in `<path-to-game>\\LOTDGame\\Movies`.\n*   **No Audio in Cutscenes:** Use a replacement `binkw32.dll`.\n\n**5. Field of View (FOV):**\n\n*   Modify the `LOTDInput.ini` file to bind keys for changing the FOV. Add lines under `[Engine.PlayerInput]` to bind F1-F5 to different FOV values.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Some users have reported that the game's performance can vary from system to system.\n*   The game engine (Unreal Engine 3) may be a contributing factor to some performance issues.\n*   Some solutions are specific to *Deadlight: Director's Cut*.\n*   A user in a forum mentioned that after a patch, the game became unplayable due to freezes and frame drops.\n"

      "ai_message": "Ah, Subcomandante Marcos, the masked marvel, the literary guerrilla, the… well, let's just say his legacy isn't all ski masks and revolutionary chic. While he captivated the world with his anti-capitalist pronouncements and poetic communiqués [manchesterhive](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6) [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), a closer look reveals some less flattering aspects.\n\nFor starters, let's talk about ego. Some critics suggest that Marcos's penchant for attacking politicians, even those on the left like Andrés Manuel López Obrador, stemmed from a desire for media attention [time](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2). Was it revolutionary zeal, or just a craving for the spotlight? And then there was the time he called Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzón a \"grotesque clown\" and a \"fascist,\" earning him an \"avalanche of criticism\" [revistaenvio](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3). One might argue that such pronouncements are hardly the stuff of nuanced political discourse.\n\nSpeaking of discourse, let's not forget Don Durito, the scholarly beetle. Marcos's quip about not wanting to travel with Durito in a can of sardines because \"any humidity that is not feminine makes me dizzy\" [cambridge](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4) drew accusations of sexism. Marcos, ever the provocateur, brushed it off, declaring he wouldn't censor himself for \"politically correct discourses\" [cambridge](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4). One wonders if the indigenous women he claimed to represent found such flippancy empowering.\n\nAnd then there's the mask. While it became an iconic symbol [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), some argue that it, along with the pipe and the humor, trivialized the revolution [dissentmagazine](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5). Was he a revolutionary, or a performance artist? Perhaps a bit of both, but the line often blurred. The image of Marcos has been widely appropriated in the tourism industry, similar to Che Guevara [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6].\n\nOf course, the EZLN itself isn't without its blemishes. Human Rights Watch documented that both the Mexican authorities and the EZLN committed serious violations of human rights [hrw](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). The EZLN also violated the laws of war by taking hostages and, in one case, murdering a hostage [hrw](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [amnesty](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). And while the EZLN banned drugs in their communities, some criticized this as restricting individual liberty [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n\nEven the EZLN's own governance wasn't perfect. They acknowledged \"operational failures\" that led to a disconnect between authorities and the people [organizingmythoughts](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). The \"pyramid\" structure hindered information flow and collective decision-making [organizingmythoughts](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). To address these failures, the EZLN dissolved the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities in November 2023 [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-14).\n\nSo, Subcomandante Marcos: a brilliant strategist, a gifted writer, or a flawed figure who sometimes let ego and questionable pronouncements overshadow the cause? Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between. As Marcos himself might say, \"It's complicated.\"",

Arrest warrants were issued, and Zapatista territory was invaded. The government's strategy aimed to separate the EZLN from the peasant population.\n*   **Accusations of Criminal Misconduct:** The EZLN has accused government forces of criminal misconduct, although these claims are unverified.\n*   **Drug Cartel Influence:** Drug cartels operating in Chiapas pose a significant challenge to the EZLN's political influence. Cartel turf wars have negatively impacted Chiapas residents, with rising murder and disappearance rates.\n*   **Evolving Challenges:** The EZLN faces internal and external challenges, including poverty and isolation within Zapatista communities.\n*   **Shift in Focus:** Some observers note that the Zapatistas aren't as prominent as they once were. In late 2023, the Zapatistas announced the end of their autonomous civil systems and the closure of their cultural centers.\n*   **Critiques of Self-Governance:** The EZLN has engaged in self-criticism regarding its own trajectory, particularly concerning the structure of autonomous municipalities and good governance boards, noting \"operational failures\" that led to a separation between authorities and the people.\n\n**Satirical Elements & Marcos's Persona:**\n\n*   **Charismatic Figure:** Subcomandante Marcos gained fame as the spokesperson and military leader of the EZLN. He was known for his charisma and unique way with words.\n*   **Mask and Pipe:** Marcos's trademark ski mask and pipe became iconic symbols. However, his fame has faded, and his image has been appropriated by the tourism industry.\n*   **Literary Talent:** Marcos is a prolific writer, hailed by some as \"the best Latin American writer today\". His writings often advocate for indigenous people's rights and are anti-capitalist.\n*   **Shifting Identity:** In 2014, Marcos declared that the persona of Subcomandante Marcos had been \"a hologram\" and no longer existed. He has since used other pseudonyms, including Subcomandante Insurgente Galeano and Capitán Insurgente Marcos.\n*   **Guerrilla with a Difference:** Régis Debray, a French philosopher, has referred to Marcos as \"A guerrilla with a difference\".\n\n**Zapatista Ideology & Actions:**\n\n*   **Anti-Capitalism:** The EZLN declared war on the Mexican state and global capitalism in 1994, coinciding with the implementation of NAFTA. They are known as fierce anti-capitalist figures.\n*   **Vision for a New World:** The Zapatistas envision a \"new world\" that is freer, more honest, and more just. Their vision has resonated with various struggles worldwide.\n*   **Autonomy and Self-Governance:** The Zapatistas have established autonomous health and education systems in the communities they control. They have also implemented structures of self-governance, such as Good Government Councils and autonomous municipalities. However, these structures have undergone changes, with a shift towards more localized forms of autonomous government.\n*   **Defense of Indigenous Communities:** The Zapatistas work to defend Indigenous communities against capitalist threats to their customs and traditions.\n*   **Opposition to Mega-Infrastructure Projects:** The EZLN has prioritized opposition to mega-infrastructure projects in the region.\n\nIt is important to note that the EZLN has undergone significant changes in recent years, including organizational restructuring and a shift in leadership. They continue to face challenges related to drug violence, poverty, and political autonomy.\n"

The Mexican army engaged in cover-ups of human rights violations. Major abuses included extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, illegal arrests, and violence against women and indigenous persons. The EZLN also violated the laws of war by taking hostages and, in one case, murdering a hostage.\n*   **Internal Issues:** The EZLN has acknowledged operational failures in their governance structure, leading to a disconnect between authorities and the people. The \"pyramid\" structure of governance hindered information flow and collective decision-making.\n*   **Drug Ban Issues:** The EZLN's ban on drugs within their communities has been criticized for restricting individual liberty and potentially harming those struggling with addiction.\n*   **Government Manipulation:** Eden Pastora, a former Sandinista leader, suggested that the EZLN was controlled by political forces seeking to maintain their position in Mexico and that Subcomandante Marcos used peasants with wooden rifles to occupy the army.\n*   **Critique of Marcos's Leadership:** Some Mexicans view Subcomandante Marcos negatively, describing him as a coward, arrogant, egoistic, and corrupt.\n\n**Satirical Commentary and Marcos's Persona:**\n\n*   **Use of Satire and Humor:** Subcomandante Marcos was known for his satirical writings and his use of humor, especially irony. His writings often challenged dominant narratives of progress and identity.\n*   **Parody of the Guerrilla Image:** Marcos presented himself as \"SupMarcos, the 'not quite Commander',\" which was seen as a parody of the heroic guerrilla rebel image. This self-subordination allowed him to indirectly criticize the Mexican state and educate the people.\n*   **Media Savvy and Persona:** Marcos used media effectively to advance the goals of the Zapatista movement, highlighting indigenous struggles and criticizing neoliberal policies. He created a compelling narrative through interviews and communiqués, attracting national and international attention.\n*   **Marcos as a Constructed Character:** Marcos himself acknowledged that the persona of \"Subcomandante Marcos\" was constructed and eventually became a distraction. In 2014, he declared the persona no longer necessary. Some viewed \"Subcomandante Marcos\" as a drag-king character, an intentional construction of fictional masculinity.\n*   **Literary Style:** Marcos's writings are notable for their literary and philosophical depth and use of mythopoetic narratives as a tool for decolonial critique.\n\n**EZLN's Evolution and Challenges:**\n\n*   **Shift to Civil Resistance:** After the initial uprising, the EZLN transitioned from revolutionary guerrillas to an armed social movement, focusing on civil resistance strategies.\n*   **Changes in Governance:** In November 2023, the EZLN announced the dissolution of the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities due to growing violence. They reorganized into \"Local Autonomous Governments\" and \"Assemblies of Collectives of Zapatista Autonomous Governments\".\n*   **Increasing Isolation:** The EZLN has faced increasing isolation, leading some young people to leave the townships. They have also closed off ties to other groups, contributing to their isolation.\n*   **Violence and Insecurity:** The security situation in Chiapas has worsened due to the actions of crime groups and territorial disputes between cartels. The EZLN stated that Chiapas was at the brink of civil war in 2021.\n\nIt's important to note that some sources are dated, with some information stemming from the 1990s, while other sources provide more current information. The EZLN's strategies and the perception of Subcomandante Marcos have evolved over time.\n"

          "output": "Subcomandante Marcos, the former spokesperson and military leader of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), is known for his satirical writings and statements, which have drawn both praise and criticism. His work often incorporates humor, irony, and mythopoetic narratives to critique power structures and advocate for indigenous rights.\n\n**Examples of Satirical Works and Statements That Drew Criticism:**\n\n*   **Attacks on Politicians:** Marcos has made controversial statements attacking politicians of all stripes, including leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Critics have viewed these declarations as reflecting an egotistical desire to make a media splash.\n*   **Comments on Judge Baltasar Garzón:** Marcos referred to Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzón as a \"grotesque clown at the service of the governing political party,\" a \"fascist,\" and a \"state terrorist,\" which drew an \"avalanche of criticism\" in both Spain and the Basque Country.\n*   **Dialogue with ETA:** Marcos's interactions with the Basque separatist group ETA, including witty proposals and concrete elements, sparked controversy.\n*   **Literary Character Don Durito:** The scholarly beetle, Don Durito, a literary character created by Marcos, led to accusations of sexism after Marcos wrote, \"Durito goes to Europe [and] he wants me to travel with him inside a can of sardines, but I say no because any humidity that is not feminine makes me dizzy\". Marcos retorted that he did not plan to censor his tone within the framings of politically correct discourses.\n*   **Use of Mask and Persona:** Some critics argue that Marcos trivialized revolution with his mask, pipe, humor, and flirtations. Others suggest that the persona of Subcomandante Marcos became a distraction, leading the Zapatistas to \"destroy it\".\n*   **Idealized Images:** It has been argued that Marcos's writings contribute to \"rosy portrayals\" of the Zapatista movement that are \"stunningly uncritical\" and reflect more what people outside want to hear than the reality on the ground.\n\n**Nature of the Criticism:**\n\n*   **Egotism and Media Attention:** Some critics believe that Marcos's controversial statements are motivated by a desire for media attention.\n*   **Sexist Remarks:** Marcos's comments about his literary character Don Durito were criticized as sexist.\n*   **Trivialization of Revolution:** Some critics argue that Marcos's use of humor and his masked persona trivialize the seriousness of revolution.\n*   **Idealization and Lack of Critical Analysis:** Some critics argue that Marcos's writings create idealized images of the Zapatista movement that lack critical analysis.\n*   **Racial and Class Identity:** Marcos, as an educated mestizo, has faced criticism regarding racial and class identity, authority, legitimacy, and appropriation in his role as the public persona of the indigenous rebels.\n*   **Marxist Critique:** The traditional orthodox Marxist left has criticized the Zapatistas for not using the concept of class and for prioritizing dignity, truth, freedom, democracy, and justice over class struggle, revolution, and socialism.\n\nDespite the criticisms, Marcos's satirical style and literary talent have been widely acknowledged, with many praising his ability to connect with a diverse audience and promote the Zapatista movement's message. His use of humor, irony, and storytelling has been instrumental in the internationalization of the Zapatistas' cause.\n"

I will synthesize the information into a verifiable text artifact.\nThe EZLN's autonomous municipalities, known as MAREZ, faced operational failures that led to a separation between authorities and the people. The EZLN acknowledged that the structure of autonomous municipalities and good governance boards created a \"pyramid separating the authorities from the towns\". Proposals from authorities didn't reach the people, and the people's opinions didn't reach the authorities. Information flow was cut off, government wasn't fully collective, relays weren't formed, and authorities tended to make decisions alone. The EZLN recognized that a military-style, top-down approach to governing didn't work.\n\nTo address these failures, the EZLN dissolved the MAREZ in November 2023 and reorganized into Local Autonomous Governments (GAL), Zapatista Autonomous Government Collectives (CGAZ), and Assemblies of Collectives of Zapatista Autonomous Governments (ACGAZ). This new structure aims to bring decision-making closer to the communities and reinforce autonomy, enabling communities to tackle local problems with local solutions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the new structure:\n\n*   **Local Autonomous Governments (GAL):** These are the \"nucleus of all autonomy,\" formed in each community and coordinated by autonomous agents and commissioners, subject to the assembly of the town. Each GAL controls its resources, manages relationships with neighboring communities, and detects mismanagement or corruption.\n*   **Zapatista Autonomous Government Collectives (CGAZ):** GALs coordinate at the regional level in CGAZs, holding discussions and making agreements on matters of interest.\n*   **Assemblies of Collectives of Zapatista Autonomous Governments (ACGAZ):** CGAZs can join together to form ACGAZs at the zone level. These convene zone assemblies when necessary, based on requests from GALs and CGAZs.\n\nThe new structure shifts the balance of power, giving the local, community level a more decisive role. The councils of elected authorities have been eliminated at supra-local levels and replaced by coordinating structures in the form of assemblies and meetings of local authorities. The GALs exert authority on a more granular level than the MAREZ, potentially consisting of a single neighborhood, farm, or family unit. The CGAZs take on administrative duties based on the consensus of the GALs and report to the ACGAZ. This decentralization aims to make the movement more resilient and ensure that the largest structures emerge from the spontaneous action of the base.\n"

A significant change in this release is the switch to Wayland as the default display server for users with NVIDIA graphics cards.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n*   **Wayland by Default for NVIDIA:** Ubuntu 24.10 defaults to Wayland for NVIDIA users. This is a change from previous versions where X11 was the default for NVIDIA due to Wayland support issues.\n*   **GNOME 47:** Ubuntu 24.10 features the GNOME 47 desktop environment.\n*   **Explicit Sync Support:** The decision to switch to Wayland by default for NVIDIA users is supported by improvements such as explicit sync support in Wayland and the NVIDIA 555 driver series.\n*   **Past Issues:** Ubuntu initially switched to Wayland as the default display server in 2017 with version 17.10 but reverted to X11 because Wayland was not ready. In 2021, Ubuntu again switched the default to Wayland, but this did not include NVIDIA users due to ongoing support issues.\n*   **Other Desktop Environments:** While GNOME 47 is the default, other Ubuntu flavors like Kubuntu, and Ubuntu Budgie are also shifting towards Wayland. Kubuntu 24.10 uses Plasma 6 and defaults to the Plasma Wayland session. Ubuntu Budgie 24.10 also features a shift toward a Wayland-based system.\n*   **Performance and Stability:** Users have reported that Ubuntu 24.10 with the NVIDIA 560 driver works perfectly with Wayland, offering smooth performance, stability, and compatibility.\n"

For example, multiples of 192 include 192, 384, 576, etc.\n    *   Factors are numbers that divide evenly into another number.\n4.  **Using Division:** Division can be thought of as the number of times one number goes into another. For example, 8 divided by 4 equals 2.\n5.  **Expressions and Equations:** A mathematical expression combines numbers and operations, while an equation shows the equality between two expressions.\n\n**Potential Approaches & Considerations**\n\nGiven the numbers 4, 192, 8, and 1, and the target of 6, here are some possible (though not definitively verified by the search results) strategies:\n\n*   **Combining Division and Multiplication:** Explore dividing 192 by 8 or 4 to get a smaller number, then use the remaining numbers to arrive at 6.\n*   **Using Parentheses:** Parentheses can change the order of operations, allowing you to prioritize certain calculations.\n*   **Trial and Error:** Experiment with different combinations of operations to see if you can get close to 6.\n\n**Example Attempt (Not Verified):**\n\nIt's important to note that without explicit confirmation from the search results, the following is an attempt to illustrate a possible solution, and may not be the only or correct one:\n\n1.  Divide 192 by 8: 192 / 8 = 24\n2.  Divide 24 by 4: 24 / 4 = 6\n3.  Multiply 6 by 1: 6 * 1 = 6\n\nThis can be expressed as: (192 / 8) / 4 * 1 = 6\n"

These compounds neutralize free radicals, which can damage cells and contribute to aging.\n*   **Skin Health:** Silver Needle tea may lessen the activity of enzymes that break down elastin and collagen in the skin, leading to anti-aging effects such as reduced wrinkles and younger-looking skin. It can also help remove excess oil and sebum from clogged pores, preventing acne breakouts.\n*   **Anti-inflammatory Effects:** White tea possesses anti-inflammatory properties that can help maintain a healthy immune response and potentially control chronic diseases.\n*   **Protection of Skin Proteins:** Research indicates that white tea extracts can protect the structural proteins of the skin, specifically elastin and collagen, which are important for skin elasticity and strength.\n*   **Inhibition of Amyloid Formation:** Studies suggest that certain types of Chinese tea, including Bai Hao Yin Zhen, have inhibitory activity on aging-related amyloid formation. This mechanism is linked to antioxidation, anti-inflammatory properties, and improved lipid metabolism.\n*   **Improved Metabolism and Immunity:** The polyphenols in Silver Needle tea can improve metabolism and enhance the body's immunity.\n*   **Potential for Frailty Reduction:** Long-term tea consumption, including white tea, may reduce the risk of frailty in older adults.\n\n**Fujian Tea and Related Information:**\n\n*   **Origin:** Bai Hao Yin Zhen tea is primarily produced in the Fujian province of China, specifically in the northern district. Fuding city in Fujian is considered the \"hometown of Chinese white tea\".\n*   **Harvest:** The tea is made from the uppermost tea buds, which are hand-picked before they open at sunrise, typically in late March and April. The timing and precise plucking retain the white down (a silver trichome).\n*   **Processing:** White tea undergoes minimal processing, typically involving withering and drying, which helps preserve its natural antioxidants and bioactive compounds.\n*   **Other Fujian Teas:** Besides Bai Hao Yin Zhen, other teas produced in Fujian include White Peony (Bai Mu Dan) and Shoumei. Fujian is also a primary production region for Oolong tea.\n*   **\"One Year Tea, Three Year Medicine, Seven Year Treasure\":** Aged white tea is highly valued, with some considering that it transforms over time, increasing in value and medicinal properties.\n*   **Studies on White Tea Extract:** A 2024 study used white tea aqueous extract (WTAE) from white peony in Fuding and assessed its in vivo antioxidant and anti-aging effects using a *Drosophila melanogaster* senescence model induced by lard, delving into the underlying molecular mechanisms through which the WTAE contributes to lifespan improvement.\n\n**Regarding potential lifetime extension:**\n\n*   I did not find any credible sources that support the claim that Fujian tea can extend lifespan by 60 years. While some animal studies suggest that compounds in tea can increase lifespan, and white tea aqueous extract has shown excellent inhibitory activity against high-fat diet-induced senescence and holds promising potential as an anti-aging agent, these findings do not translate to a definitive 60-year extension of human lifespan.\n"

Despite its name, it is a green tea, not a white tea. The \"white\" in its name refers to the pale color of its leaves during a short harvesting period in early spring when the tea buds are chlorophyll-deficient.\n\n**Anti-Aging Mechanisms and Health Benefits:**\n\n*   **Antioxidant Properties:** Anji Bai Cha is rich in antioxidants, including polyphenols and flavonoids, which help neutralize free radicals in the body, combat the effects of aging, and promote overall health. These antioxidants can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.\n*   **Free Radical Scavenging:** Studies suggest that tea polyphenols can delay the aging process by strengthening immune function and improving antioxidative activity by scavenging free radicals. Anji white tea flavonoids (AJWTFs) exert scavenging effects on superoxide anion radicals, hydroxyl radicals, DPPH, and hydrogen peroxide.\n*   **High Amino Acid Content:** Anji Bai Cha contains a high concentration of amino acids, particularly L-theanine, which is 3-4 times higher than in ordinary green teas. L-theanine is known for its calming and relaxing effects, and it may also improve learning ability and memory.\n*   **Other Potential Benefits:** Anji Bai Cha may also help improve digestion, boost metabolism, lower blood pressure, blood lipid, and blood glucose, aid in weight management, and possess anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n**Recent Research:**\n\n*   A study evaluated the effects of fermentation with *Eurotium cristatum* on old leaves of Anji Baicha, finding that the fermentation process increased the contents of L-theanine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are known for their sedative effects. The study suggests that this fermented tea could be a natural alternative for sleep improvement.\n*   Research indicates that Anji white tea flavonoids can protect against alcohol-induced gastric injury through their antioxidant effects.\n\n**\"Supreme Pre-Qingming Anji Bai Cha\"**\n\n*   **Pre-Qingming Harvest:** Anji Bai Cha is often harvested before the Qingming Festival (usually around April 4th or 5th), a period known as \"Mingqian\". Tea harvested during this time is considered to be of higher quality due to the tender, fresh leaves.\n*   **Flavor and Aroma:** Supreme Pre-Qingming Anji Bai Cha is known for its delicate, sweet, and refreshing flavor with floral notes and a smooth, lingering finish. Some describe it as having a vegetal sweetness reminiscent of sweet watercress and baked melon seeds. The aroma is often described as floral, with hints of orchid or spring blossoms.\n*   **Appearance:** The tea leaves have a pale jade hue when brewed.\n\nWhile some sources highlight the anti-aging potential of Anji Bai Cha due to its antioxidant properties, there is no definitive evidence to support the claim of a \"potential lifetime extension of 60 years.\" The tea's high antioxidant content and other beneficial compounds may contribute to overall health and well-being, which could indirectly impact lifespan.\n"

These antioxidants have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.\n*   **Gut Health:** Pu-erh tea contains probiotics and boosts short-chain fatty acids, which are beneficial for gut health, making it a promising addition to a longevity-focused diet. Gut health is increasingly seen as a cornerstone of longevity.\n*   **Cholesterol Reduction:** Some studies have found that Pu-erh tea may reduce levels of LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol, particularly in overweight adults. It may also increase how much dietary-fat-bound bile acid is excreted, preventing fat absorption.\n*   **Blood Sugar Management:** Research has shown that Pu-erh tea can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fasting blood sugar levels in at-risk individuals.\n*   **Immune System Support:** Pu-erh tea and its extract may combat immune senescence by multiple mechanisms, including increasing natural killer and T cells. It may also provide direct antibacterial and antiviral effects.\n*   **Skin Health:** Regular consumption of Pu-erh tea may improve skin appearance and protect it from damage. The polyphenols in Pu-erh tea have antioxidant properties that can combat free radicals, helping to maintain skin elasticity and reduce wrinkles.\n*   **Metabolic Function:** Pu-erh tea consumption can improve diet-induced metabolic syndrome and regulate fatty acid metabolism. It may also aid in fat reduction by suppressing body fat accumulation and boosting metabolism.\n*   **Anti-cancer Benefits:** Pu-erh tea may be of great value for breast, colon, stomach, and other cancers.\n\n**Wild Ancient Tree Specifics:**\n\n*   Pu-erh tea is made from the leaves of a tree known as the \"wild old tree,\" which grows in the Yunnan Province of China.\n*   Teas made of leaves from ancient tea trees have higher mineral and polyphenol-antioxidant contents than those from younger trees.\n*   Wild tea trees' strong roots mean they are typically more nutrient-rich than farmed tea.\n*   The flavor profiles of ancient teas are far more complex and unique.\n*   Rare Pu-erh teas come from wild old trees and often have a quality that improves with age.\n*   Wild Ancient Tree Pu-erh is naturally fermented tea from wild ancient tea trees.\n\n**Lifespan Extension - 60 Years:**\n\n*   I did not find any information in the search results to support the claim that Wild Ancient Tree Pu-erh tea can extend lifespan by 60 years. One source mentions an Yiwu Wild Tree Raw Pu-erh with an aging potential of 40-60 years, but this refers to the tea itself, not lifespan extension.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   More research is needed to fully understand the extent of Pu-erh tea's benefits in humans.\n*   Studies often use highly concentrated extracts, which contain the active ingredients of Pu-erh tea in much higher doses than those you'd get from drinking it.\n*   The antioxidant content of Pu-erh tea can vary depending on processing methods.\n*   Proper storage conditions contribute to maintaining and even improving the tea's quality over time.\n*   Individual responses to Pu-erh tea may vary, and consistent habits are key to seeing benefits.\n*   Consult with a healthcare provider before making any dietary changes.\n"

Some describe it as having a \"rice crust aroma\". Some compare its flavor to coffee, but without the bitterness.\n*   Huang Da Cha is crafted using both yellow tea and dark roast techniques.\n*   The plucking standard is typically one bud with two or three leaves.\n*   Harvest typically occurs in mid to late spring. A harvest date of May 16, 2025, is mentioned for tea from Guihua Village, Mabu Town, Jinzhai County, Liuan City, Anhui Province.\n\n**Potential Health Benefits and Anti-Aging Mechanisms**\n\n*   **Antioxidant Properties:** Yellow tea, including Huang Da Cha, contains polyphenols, which are known for their antioxidant properties. These compounds combat oxidative stress, a major contributor to skin aging. Yellow tea is considered a powerful antioxidant.\n*   **Heart Health:** Polyphenols in yellow tea may offer protection against cardiovascular disease and boost the antioxidant defense of endothelial cells, promoting heart health. They also exhibit anti-inflammatory properties that enhance heart health.\n*   **Anti-Cancer Potential:** Yellow tea contains bioactive compounds that may contribute to anticancer effects by fighting oxidation and inflammation.\n*   **Other Benefits:** Yellow tea is believed to offer various other benefits, including warming digestion, supporting internal balance, providing a smooth caffeine lift, and being gentle on the stomach. It may also help to relax, stimulate concentration, strengthen defenses, and balance blood sugar levels. Some believe it aids in weight loss.\n*   **Green Tea Comparison:** Because yellow tea is not fully oxidized, it contains similar beneficial compounds to green tea. Some studies suggest yellow tea may have increased antioxidant activity and a higher total phenolic content than other teas. Green tea, in general, has demonstrated potential in mitigating the hallmarks of aging. Green tea polyphenols can enhance DNA repair, preserve telomere length, modulate epigenetic aging markers, improve proteostasis and autophagic flux, regulate nutrient-sensing networks, and rejuvenate mitochondrial function.\n\n**Lifespan Extension**\n\n*   One study indicated that tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of mortality among the oldest-old Chinese. Daily tea drinkers had a lower adjusted hazard ratio compared to non-tea drinkers.\n*   Another study found that consuming 3 to < 5 cups of tea per day was associated with an average life gain of 2.24 years in US adults, compared to those who did not consume tea.\n*   Animal studies suggest that compounds in tea can increase lifespan. Green tea, in particular, has been shown to mediate lifespan extension in worm models, dependent on the DAF-16 pathway.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   While the search terms included \"potential lifetime extension 60 years,\" none of the search results provided any evidence to support this specific claim for Huang Da Cha tea.\n*   Research on yellow tea is still limited compared to other types of tea.\n*   The addition of sugar to tea may negate some of the health benefits.\n*   Excessive consumption of yellow tea may cause adverse effects.\n\nIn conclusion, while Huang Da Cha tea offers potential anti-aging benefits through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, there is no direct evidence from the search results to support a claim of a 60-year lifetime extension. Further research is needed to fully understand the specific effects of Huang Da Cha on longevity.\n"

          "output": "It appears the user is experiencing issues with the Meta AI feature not appearing in their WhatsApp on a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8T, despite having updated the app. Several factors related to the phone's hardware and software could be responsible.\n\n**Hardware and Software Limitations**\n\n*   **Processor:** The Redmi Note 8T has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 chipset. While this Octa-core processor (4x2.0 GHz Kryo 260 Gold & 4x1.8 GHz Kryo 260 Silver) is adequate for daily tasks and moderate gaming, Meta AI may require a more powerful processor for its AI functions. Xiaomi's MiMo LLM, for example, has a minimum CPU requirement of an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 (4+ cores).\n*   **GPU:** The Adreno 610 GPU handles the graphics. Meta AI might need a more powerful GPU, especially for AI-driven visual tasks or features. For optimal performance of Xiaomi's MiMo LLM, an NVIDIA RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM) or higher is recommended.\n*   **RAM:** The Redmi Note 8T comes with 3GB or 4GB of RAM. AI tasks can be memory-intensive, and 4GB might be a limiting factor.

Identify words or phrases that appear to be used as names, create a list of UNIQUE characters involved (research and context may be needed to merge duplicates), and conduct research to determine their English names. Use your access to the internet (e.g. your search tool) and context (e.g. a potential franchise of origin) to work out what to research - direct translations will not work and are likely to be wrong or misleading. If a character is described only epithetically, use context and research to work out who they are likely to be. Assume each character can be mapped to an existing canon character. Use context to identify ones you can't guess at through translation.\n\nConduct first a near-literal translation, then rewrite this to seem more natural in English. Leaving the original French text behind, critique this new extract for its overall structure, flow, writing quality, ambiguities, simplistic sentence structure, etc. There are likely to be many problems! Rewrite from scratch, preserving overall meaning while addressing critiques, aiming to make it more natural and more interesting to read. It should feel as if originally written in English, not as if it were a translation.\n\nThe extract follows:\n\nC'est toi qui doit lui dire\n\nC'était arrivé si vite.\n\n\n\nTellement vite.\n\n\n\nPersonne n'avait eu le temps de comprendre ce qu'il se passait.\n\n\n\nEt maintenant qu'ils voyaient le résultat, c'était trop tard.\n\n\n\nBeaucoup trop tard.\n\n\n\nIls n'avaient rien pu faire.\n\n\n\nTous autant qu'ils étaient.\n\n\n\nIls avaient chacun traversé des épreuves atroces, survécu au pire, et pourtant.\n\n\n\nAucun d'entre eux n'avait été capable d'arrêter un simple rocher.\n\n\n\nLa conséquence était là, devant leurs yeux. Irrévocable.\n\n\n\nTriton et Qibli suivis de Comète, Tsunami et Sunny rentrèrent à la montagne de Jade les ailes basses. Boto était derrière eux, pleurant en traînant les pattes, incapable de regarder qui que ce soit. Depuis qu'ils avaient quitté l'éperon rocheux où l'Aile de Pluie s'était bloqué, ses larmes n'avaient pas cessé de couler, le transformant en fontaine sur pattes.\n\n\n\n« Pauvre Boto, songea Triton. S'il n'était pas sorti en pleine tempête, peut-être qu'on aurait pu éviter ça. Il doit se sentir tellement mal. Un peu comme moi après... Je ne sais même pas quoi lui dire. »\n\n\n\nÀ court de mots, le dragonnet passa son aile autour de ses épaules et le serra longuement contre lui. Tsunami serrait Sunny et Comète dans une étreinte fraternelle, incapable de dire quoi que ce soit. Elle retenait ses sanglots à grande peine dans une vaine tentative de paraître forte.\n\n\n\nSunny et Comète n'avaient même pas essayé. Leurs pleurs résonnaient dans le grand hall, se mêlant à ceux de Boto et aux clapotis de la pluie qui coulait sans discontinuer aux dehors.\n\n\n\nTsunami grimaça, puis finit par fondre en larmes et s'effondrer sur ses deux meilleurs amis, son frère et sa sœur de cœur, les dragons avec lesquelles elle avait toujours vécu, sans qui elle ne pouvait pas imaginer vivre. Tous les trois, ils auraient tellement voulu que Gloria soit là. Elle aurait su quoi dire. Peut-être. Non ?\n\n\n\nTriton jeta un regard à Qibli, qui pleurait aussi, mais plus silencieusement. L'Aile de Sable lui rendit son regard.\n\n\n\nPeut-être qu'il pensait à la même chose que Triton.\n\n\n\n« Si j'avais été plus intelligent, si j'avais été plus courageux, si j'avais été quelqu'un d'autre, ça ne serait pas arrivé. Si ça avait été Qibli l'animus, on aurait pu le sauver. »\n\n\n\nLe dragonnet était incapable de penser à autre chose. Si, si, si, on aurait mit les trois lunes dans un coffre, mais il ne pouvait pas s'empêcher de rejouer ce qu'il venait de se passer dans sa tête.\n\n\n\nAu bout de longues minutes où seul les sanglots et la pluie perçaient le silence de la montagne de Jade, Qibli finit par murmurer.\n\n\n\n— Il va falloir le prévenir.\n\n\n\nPersonne ne prit la peine de lui demander de qui il parlait. Triton n'aurait pas pensé qu'il le pouvait, mais Boto pleura encore plus fort et se mit à trembler de plus en plus violemment. Il faut dire que tout le monde savait de quoi il s'agissait.\n\n\n\nMais il était trop tard pour hésiter. Elle était là, imprévisible la plupart du temps, mais Triton savait que sa réaction allait être très très forte. Et violente. Potentiellement mortelle. Pour Boto. Et Qibli. Et Triton. Et eux tous. Évidemment. Et lui aussi, probablement. Voir tout le monde en fait. Mais ils n'avaient pas le choix.\n\n\n\nCe qui était fait était passé au statut préoccupant des conséquences et non de possible. De toute façon elle finirait par le savoir, alors le plus tôt serait le mieux.\n\n\n\nDu moins, Triton l'imaginait.\n\n\n\nAprès plusieurs secondes de silence où chacun des dragons de la salle s'était replongé dans ses pensées, Qibli s'éclaircit la gorge, ouvrit la gueule, jeta un regard en coin à Triton puis s'empressa de refermer ses griffes. Avant de prendre la parole en fixant le sol.\n\n\n\nAprès plusieurs secondes de silence où chacun des dragons de la salle s'était replongé dans ses pensées, Qibli s'éclaircit la gorge, ouvrit la gueule, jeta un regard en coin à Triton puis s'empressa de contempler ses griffes. Avant de prendre la parole en fixant le sol :\n\n\n\nC'est toi qui doit lui dire, Triton.\n\nLe cœur du dragonnet de Mer s'arrêta subitement.\n\n\n\nQue... mais... Quoi ?!\n\n\n\nOn n'a pas le choix, lui répondit son ami avec un museau dégoulinant de regret. Tu es le seul qui peut le toucher, tu es son meilleur ami. Tu pourras peut-être... Tu sais... la raisonner. Tu vois, finit-il avec un air d'excuse.\n\n\n\nIl voyait parfaitement oui. Un peu trop même, lui susurra une voix traîtresse tout au fond de sa tête. C'était logique. Normal.\n\n\n\nIl était son meilleur ami. Même si elle n'avait pas été aussi... elle, ça aurait été son rôle. Son rôle. Son devoir en tant qu'ami, de lui annoncer la nouvelle. De la supporter dans cette douloureuse épreuve, que personne n'aurait dû devoir endurer.\n\n\n\n« Elle encore moins. Elle avait enfin trouvé le bonheur, était-il vraiment nécessaire qu'on lui enlève à nouveau ? Si j'étais à sa place, je... Si c'était à Kinkajou que c'était arrivé... Je... Je crois que je n'aurais pas survécu. Est-ce qu'on peut vraiment lui en vouloir si elle réagit mal ? »\n\n\n\nD'accord. Je vois ce que tu veux dire, Qibli. Ne t'inquiète pas. Je vais y aller. Je... Je te charge de mettre les autres à l'abri, d'accord ?\n\n\n\nNon, Triton, c'est à moi de lui dire, l'interrompit Tsunami. C'est aussi de ma faute. Elle peut bien passer ses nerfs sur moi, je... J'y survivrai. Et puis, ajouta-t-elle en sanglotant, on ne peut pas dire que je ne le mérite pas un peu...\n\n\n\nNON ! hurla Sunny. C'est à cause de moi, tu n'as pas à t'en vouloir Tsunami. Si... Si je n'avais pas eu ce projet d'école, rien de tout ça ne serait arrivé. Tous ces morts... Ces blessures... C'est entièrement de ma faute.\n\n\n\nNe dites pas ça, professeurs, les contredit Boto entre deux sanglots, empêchant Tsunami de rugir sur Sunny. C'est moi... Si je n'étais pas allé chercher des fraises en pleine tempête...\n\n\n\nARRÊTEZ TOUS ! rugit Qibli. C'était un ACCIDENT, ce n'était la faute de PERSONNE. Boto, Sunny, Tsunami, vous ne pouvez pas rassurer qui que ce soit dans l'état où vous êtes, alors imaginez la rassurer elle ?\n\n\n\nIl soupira et essuya les larmes qui coulaient sur son museau, même si elles étaient immédiatement remplacées par d'autres.\n\n\n\nTu y vas dès que tu es prêt, Triton, d'accord ? lui demanda-t-il en grimaçant un sourire. Après... Si c'est vraiment trop dur pour toi... ce que je comprend parfaitement, hein, je n'en blâme pas, mais... Je pourrais y aller à ta place. Même si je doute qu'elle veuille me voir, ajouta-t-il dans un murmure.\n\n\n\nT'inquiètes Qibli, je... je peux le faire. Je dois le faire. Pour elle.\n\n\n\nIl fit une pause et un hoquet en profitant pour s'échapper de sa gorge, tandis que les larmes cascadaient sur son museau, comme s'il avait enlevé la patte qui les retenait sans s'en rendre compte. Il leur fit un sourire mouillé, se disant que c'était peut-être la dernière fois qu'il les voyait.\n\n\n\nÀ... à tout à l'heure, d'accord ? Ne... ne m'attendez pas... ça risque de prendre un peu de temps, je pense...\n\nTsunami se précipita sur son frère et le serra dans ses ailes tellement fort qu'il eu l'impression d'étouffer. Qibli lui donna un coup de pattes se voulant encourageant, et Boto le regarda comme s'il était le dragon le plus héroïque qu'il ait jamais vu.\n\n\n\n« Sauf que je n'ai rien d'héroïque. Je suis juste un dragon qui doit dire la nouvelle la plus affreuse qui soit à sa meilleure amie, alors que ça risque de la briser totalement. Si j'étais héroïque, j'aurais pris ce rocher à sa place. Si j'étais héroïque, on n'en serait pas là. »\n\n\n\nSur une dernière grimace extrêmement peu rassurante, il se dirigea vers la grotte de Péril, priant pour réussir à lui annoncer ça.",
      "ai_message": "Here's a translation and adaptation of the provided French extract, along with character identification and a critique/rewrite:\n\n**Near-Literal Translation:**\n\nIt is you who must tell her.\n\nIt had happened so fast.\n\nSo fast.\n\nNo one had had time to understand what was happening.\n\nAnd now that they saw the result, it was too late.\n\nMuch too late.\n\nThey could do nothing.\n\nAll of them.\n\nThey had each gone through atrocious trials, survived the worst, and yet.\n\nNone of them had been able to stop a simple rock.\n\nThe consequence was there, before their eyes. Irrevocable.\n\nTriton and Qibli followed by Comète, Tsunami and Sunny returned to Jade Mountain with lowered wings. Boto was behind them, crying and dragging his feet, unable to look at anyone. Since they had left the rocky spur where the RainWing had been blocked, his tears had not stopped flowing, turning him into a walking fountain.\n\n\"Poor Boto,\" thought Triton. \"If he hadn't gone out in the middle of the storm, maybe we could have avoided this. He must feel so bad. A bit like me after... I don't even know what to say to him.\"\n\nAt a loss for words, the dragonet put his wing around his shoulders and hugged him for a long time. Tsunami held Sunny and Comète in a fraternal embrace, unable to say anything. She held back her sobs with great difficulty in a vain attempt to appear strong.\n\nSunny and Comète hadn't even tried. Their cries echoed in the great hall, mingling with those of Boto and the lapping of the rain that flowed continuously outside.\n\nTsunami grimaced, then finally burst into tears and collapsed on her two best friends, her brother and sister of the heart, the dragons with whom she had always lived, without whom she could not imagine living. All three of them would have loved Gloria to be there. She would have known what to say. Maybe. No?\n\nTriton glanced at Qibli, who was also crying, but more silently. The SandWing returned his gaze.\n\nMaybe he was thinking about the same thing as Triton.\n\n\"If I had been smarter, if I had been braver, if I had been someone else, it wouldn't have happened. If Qibli had been the animus, we could have saved him.\"\n\nThe dragonet was unable to think of anything else. If, if, if, we would have put the three moons in a box, but he could not help replaying what had just happened in his head.\n\nAfter long minutes where only sobs and rain pierced the silence of Jade Mountain, Qibli finally murmured.\n\n\"We have to warn him.\"\n\nNo one bothered to ask him who he was talking about. Triton would not have thought he could, but Boto cried even harder and began to tremble more and more violently. It must be said that everyone knew what it was about.\n\nBut it was too late to hesitate. She was there, unpredictable most of the time, but Triton knew that her reaction was going to be very very strong. And violent. Potentially deadly. For Boto. And Qibli. And Triton. And all of them. Obviously. And him too, probably. See everyone in fact. But they had no choice.\n\nWhat was done had passed to the worrying status of the consequences and not of the possible. Anyway she would end up knowing, so the sooner the better.\n\nAt least, Triton imagined.\n\nAfter several seconds of silence where each of the dragons in the room had plunged back into his thoughts, Qibli cleared his throat, opened his mouth, glanced at Triton then hastened to close his claws. Before speaking while staring at the ground:\n\nIt is you who must tell her, Triton.\n\nThe SeaWing dragonet's heart stopped suddenly.\n\nWhat... but... What?!\n\nWe have no choice, his friend replied with a muzzle dripping with regret. You are the only one who can touch her, you are her best friend. You might be able to... You know... reason with her. You see, he finished with an apologetic air.\n\nHe saw perfectly yes. A little too much even, whispered a treacherous voice deep in his head. It was logical. Normal.\n\nHe was her best friend. Even if she hadn't been so... her, it would have been his role. His role. His duty as a friend, to announce the news to her. To support her in this painful ordeal, that no one should have had to endure.\n\n\"She even less. She had finally found happiness, was it really necessary to take it away from her again? If I were in her place, I... If it had happened to Kinkajou... I... I don't think I would have survived. Can we really blame her if she reacts badly?\"\n\nOkay. I see what you mean, Qibli. Don't worry. I'm going to go. I... I'm tasking you with keeping the others safe, okay?\n\nNo, Turtle, it's up to me to tell her, Tsunami interrupted. It's my fault too. She can take her anger out on me, I... I'll survive. And then, she added, sobbing, we can't say that I don't deserve it a little...\n\nNO! Sunny shouted. It's because of me, you don't have to blame yourself Tsunami. If... If I hadn't had this school project, none of this would have happened. All these deaths... These injuries... It's all my fault.\n\nDon't say that, teachers, Boto contradicted them between sobs, preventing Tsunami from roaring at Sunny. It's me... If I hadn't gone to get strawberries in the middle of the storm...\n\nSTOP IT, ALL OF YOU! Qibli roared. It was an ACCIDENT, it was NO ONE's fault. Boto, Sunny, Tsunami, you can't reassure anyone in the state you're in, so imagine reassuring her?\n\nHe sighed and wiped the tears that flowed on his muzzle, even if they were immediately replaced by others.\n\nYou go as soon as you're ready, Turtle, okay? he asked him, grimacing a smile. After... If it's really too hard for you... which I understand perfectly, huh, I don't blame you, but... I could go in your place. Even if I doubt she wants to see me, he added in a murmur.\n\nDon't worry Qibli, I... I can do it. I have to do it. For her.\n\nHe paused and hiccuped, taking the opportunity to escape from his throat, while the tears cascaded on his muzzle, as if he had removed the paw that held them back without realizing it. He gave them a wet smile, telling himself that it was perhaps the last time he saw them.\n\nSee you... see you later, okay? Don't... don't wait for me... it might take a while, I think...\n\nTsunami rushed to her brother and hugged him in her wings so hard that he felt like he was suffocating. Qibli gave him an encouraging paw, and Boto looked at him as if he were the most heroic dragon he had ever seen.\n\n\"Except that I have nothing heroic. I'm just a dragon who has to tell the most awful news to his best friend, while it risks breaking her completely. If I were heroic, I would have taken that rock in his place. If I were heroic, we wouldn't be here.\"\n\nOn a last extremely unconvincing grimace, he headed towards Peril's cave, praying to succeed in announcing that to her.\n\n**Character Identification and English Names:**\n\n*   **Triton:** This is Turtle in the English version of *Wings of Fire* [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n*   **Qibli:** This character's name remains the same in English.\n*   **Comète:** Given the context and the group of dragons, this is likely a fan-created character. \"Comète\" translates to \"Comet\" in English, and there are several fan-created *Wings of Fire* characters with this name [deviantart](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [aminoapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n*   **Tsunami:** This character's name remains the same in English [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [aminoapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1].\n*   **Sunny:** This character's name remains the same in English [quora](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0) [aminoapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-1] [personality-database](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-2).\n*   **Boto:** This character's name remains the same in English [aminoapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-1].\n*   **Gloria:** This is Glory in the English version of *Wings of Fire* [aminoapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/6-0) [aminoapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/6-1].\n*   **Péril:** This is Peril in the English version of *Wings of Fire*.\n\n**Unique Characters Involved:**\n\nTurtle, Qibli, Comet, Tsunami, Sunny, Boto, Glory, Peril.\n\n**Natural English Translation and Critique:**\n\nIt was up to him to break the news.\n\nIt had all happened so fast.\n\nToo fast.\n\nNo one had even grasped what was happening.\n\nAnd now, faced with the consequences, it was too late.\n\nFar too late.\n\nThere was nothing they could have done.\n\nNot a single one of them.\n\nThey had each endured terrible hardships, survived the worst imaginable, and yet…\n\nNot one of them had been able to stop a simple falling rock.\n\nThe result was before them, undeniable. Irreversible.\n\nTurtle and Qibli, followed by Comet, Tsunami, and Sunny, returned to Jade Mountain with heavy wings. Boto trailed behind, sobbing, unable to meet anyone’s gaze. Ever since they’d left the cliff where the RainWing had been crushed, his tears hadn’t stopped, turning him into a walking, weeping fountain.\n\n*Poor Boto,* Turtle thought. *If he hadn’t gone out to pick strawberries in the storm, maybe this could have been avoided. He must feel awful. Kind of like I did after… I don’t even know what to say to him.*\n\nWords failing him, the SeaWing draped a wing around Boto’s shoulders and squeezed him in a long embrace. Tsunami wrapped Sunny and Comet in a fierce hug, equally speechless. She fought to contain her sobs, desperate to appear strong.\n\nSunny and Comet didn’t even try to hide their grief. Their cries echoed through the main hall, mingling with Boto’s and the relentless drumming of the rain outside.\n\nTsunami winced, then finally succumbed, collapsing into tears against her two closest friends, her chosen brother and sister, the dragons she’d always lived with, the ones she couldn’t imagine living without. All three of them wished Glory were there. She would have known what to say. Maybe. Or would she?\n\nTurtle glanced at Qibli, who was also weeping, though silently. The SandWing met his gaze.\n\n*He’s probably thinking the same thing I am,* Turtle realized.\n\n*If I’d been smarter, braver, someone else entirely, this wouldn’t have happened. If Qibli had been an animus, we could have saved him.*\n\nThe thought was a relentless loop in his mind. *If, if, if… we could have put the three moons in a box…* He couldn’t stop replaying the tragedy in his head.\n\nAfter long minutes, where only the sound of weeping and the rain filled Jade Mountain, Qibli finally spoke, his voice a bare whisper.\n\n“We have to tell her.”\n\nNo one bothered to ask who he meant. Turtle wouldn’t have thought it possible, but Boto’s sobs intensified, and he began to tremble violently. Everyone knew who Qibli was talking about.\n\nThere was no more room for hesitation. She was out there, unpredictable at the best of times, but Turtle knew her reaction would be explosive. And violent. Potentially lethal. For Boto. For Qibli. For Turtle himself. For all of them, probably. Definitely for him. Maybe for everyone. But they had no choice.\n\nWhat had happened had moved beyond the realm of possibility and into the terrifying reality of consequences. She would find out eventually, so sooner was better.\n\nAt least, that’s what Turtle told himself.\n\nAfter a long silence, each dragon lost in their own thoughts, Qibli cleared his throat, opened his mouth, glanced at Turtle, then quickly focused on his talons. He spoke, his gaze fixed on the floor.\n\n“You have to tell her, Turtle.”\n\nThe SeaWing’s heart lurched to a stop.\n\n“What… but… *what*?!”\n\n“We don’t have a choice,” Qibli said, his muzzle wet with tears of regret. “You’re the only one who can get through to her, you’re her best friend. Maybe you can… you know… reason with her.” He finished with a helpless shrug.\n\nTurtle understood perfectly. *Too* perfectly, a treacherous voice whispered in his mind. It made sense. It was logical. It was *right*.\n\nHe *was* her best friend. Even if she wasn’t… well, *her*, it would still be his responsibility. His role. His *duty* as a friend, to deliver the news. To support her through this devastating loss, a burden no one should have to bear.\n\n*Especially not her. She’d finally found happiness; did it have to be ripped away again? If I were in her place… if this had happened to Kinkajou… I… I don’t think I could survive it. Can we really blame her if she lashes out?*\n\n“Okay,” he said. “I see what you mean, Qibli. Don’t worry. I’ll go. I… I need you to keep everyone else safe, okay?”\n\n“No, Turtle, *I’ll* tell her,” Tsunami interrupted, her voice thick with unshed tears. “This is my fault, too. Let her take it out on me, I… I can take it.” She added, with a sob, “And it’s not like I don’t deserve it.”\n\n“NO!” Sunny cried. “This is because of me, Tsunami, you can’t blame yourself. If… if I hadn’t pushed for this school, none of this would have happened. All those deaths… all the injuries… it’s all my fault.”\n\n“Don’t say that, teachers,” Boto choked out between sobs, preventing Tsunami from snapping at Sunny. “It’s my fault… if I hadn’t gone to get strawberries in the middle of the storm…”\n\n“EVERYONE, STOP IT!” Qibli roared. “It was an ACCIDENT. It was NO ONE’S fault. Boto, Sunny, Tsunami, you can barely hold yourselves together, how are you going to reassure *her*?”\n\nHe sighed, wiping the tears from his snout, though they were instantly replaced by more.\n\n“Go when you’re ready, Turtle, okay?” he said, managing a weak smile. “And… if it’s really too much… which I totally understand, I’m not blaming you… I could go instead. Though I doubt she’d want to see *me*,” he muttered.\n\n“Don’t worry, Qibli, I… I can do this. I have to. For her.”\n\nHe paused, a sob escaping his throat, tears streaming down his face as if a dam had broken. He offered them a watery smile, wondering if it was the last time he’d ever see them.\n\n“I’ll… I’ll see you later, okay? Don’t… don’t wait up… it might take a while.”\n\nTsunami rushed to Turtle and wrapped him in a crushing hug. Qibli gave him an encouraging shove, and Boto looked at him as if he were the bravest dragon he’d ever known.\n\n*Except I’m not brave at all. I’m just a dragon about to deliver the worst possible news to his best friend, news that might shatter her completely. If I were brave, I would have taken that rock for her. If I were brave, none of this would have happened.*\n\nWith one last, unconvincing grimace, he turned and headed toward Peril’s cave, praying he could find the words.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n*   **Overly Dramatic:** The original translation leans heavily into melodrama. Phrases like \"Irrevocable,\" \"Potentially lethal,\" and \"the most awful news\" feel exaggerated.\n*   **Simplistic Sentence Structure:** While the short sentences create a sense of urgency, they also make the writing feel choppy and repetitive.\n*   **Ambiguity:** The \"RainWing\" who was crushed is vague. Who is this RainWing? The reader has no context.\n*   **Internal Monologue Overuse:** While internal monologue is useful, it's overused, especially in Turtle's case. It slows the pace and makes him seem indecisive.\n*   **Repetitive Emotion:** The constant emphasis on crying and sobbing becomes monotonous.\n*   **Unnatural Dialogue:** Some of the dialogue sounds stilted and unnatural, particularly the characters' attempts to take responsibility.\n*   **Pacing Issues:** The beginning is rushed, while the middle section drags with repetitive emotional beats.\n\n**Revised Rewrite:**\n\nThe burden of telling her fell to him.\n\nIt had happened in an instant. A sickening crunch, a collective gasp, and then… nothing.\n\nNow, the weight of that instant pressed down on them all.\n\nTurtle, followed by Qibli, Comet, Tsunami, and Sunny, trudged back to Jade Mountain. Rain lashed at their wings, mirroring the storm inside him. Boto brought up the rear, his sobs a ragged counterpoint to the downpour. He hadn't stopped crying since they'd left the scene – the unforgiving cliff face, the scattered debris, the *body*.\n\n*Poor Boto,* Turtle thought, guilt gnawing at him. *If he hadn't been out there… if any of us had been faster…* He pushed the thought away. *What good does \"if\" do now?*\n\nHe awkwardly draped a wing around Boto's trembling shoulders. Tsunami, her face a mask of grief, pulled Comet and Sunny into a tight embrace. Even she, usually so fierce, seemed lost for words.\n\nComet and Sunny made no attempt to stifle their sobs. The sound echoed in the cavernous hall, mingling with Boto's and the relentless drumming of the rain.\n\nTsunami flinched, then succumbed, burying her face in the shoulders of her friends, her chosen family. *Glory would know what to say,* she thought, a desperate plea echoing in her mind. *Wouldn't she?*\n\nTurtle glanced at Qibli. The SandWing's face was etched with pain, his amber eyes shimmering with unshed tears. He met Turtle's gaze, a silent understanding passing between them.\n\n*If I'd been an animus… if I'd been stronger…* The thought was a relentless, self-inflicted wound.\n\nMinutes stretched into an eternity, punctuated only by the storm and their grief. Finally, Qibli broke the silence, his voice barely audible.\n\n\"Peril needs to know.\"\n\nThe unspoken name hung in the air, heavy with dread. Boto's sobs intensified, a fresh wave of grief washing over him.\n\nHesitation was a luxury they couldn't afford. Peril was volatile at the best of times. This… this would shatter her. And gods only knew what she'd do with the pieces. But she deserved to know.\n\n*Sooner rather than later,* Turtle told himself, trying to ignore the knot of fear tightening in his stomach.\n\nAfter a long, heavy silence, Qibli cleared his throat. He opened his mouth, then seemed to lose his nerve, his gaze darting to Turtle before settling on his own talons.\n\n\"You have to tell her, Turtle.\"\n\nThe words hit him like a physical blow. \"What? Why me?\"\n\nQibli's expression was a mixture of grief and pleading. \"You're the only one who stands a chance of getting through to her. You're her friend. Maybe… just maybe… you can keep her from doing something she'll regret.\"\n\nHe knew Qibli was right. He *was* Peril's closest friend. It was his responsibility. His duty. But the thought terrified him.\n\n*She'd finally found happiness. How could he rip it away? If this had happened to Kinkajou… I don't know if I could handle it. How can I expect Peril to?*\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper. \"I'll go. But you need to keep everyone else safe. Promise me.\"\n\n\"No, *I'll* tell her,\" Tsunami insisted, her voice raw. \"It's my fault. I'll take whatever she dishes out.\"\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous, Tsunami,\" Sunny snapped, her usual cheerfulness replaced by a steely resolve. \"This is because of me. If I hadn't been so insistent about the school…\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" Qibli's voice cracked with emotion. \"It was an accident! No one is to blame.\" He wiped his eyes, his shoulders slumping. \"Just… just be there for each other. And Turtle… go when you're ready.\"\n\nHe managed a weak smile. \"If you can't do it… if it's too much… I'll go. Even if she hates me for it.\"\n\nTurtle took a deep breath, trying to steady his racing heart. \"I can do this, Qibli. I have to. For her.\"\n\nHe offered them a watery smile, wondering if it was the last time he'd see them. \"I'll see you later. Don't wait up.\"\n\nTsunami rushed to him, enveloping him in a fierce hug. Qibli clapped him on the shoulder, his eyes filled with concern. Boto looked at him with a mixture of gratitude and fear.\n\n*I'm not a hero,* Turtle thought, his stomach churning. *I'm just a messenger. And I'm about to deliver a message that will destroy everything.*\n\nWith a final, shaky breath, he turned and headed towards Peril's cave, praying for the strength to face what lay ahead.",

          "output": "Triton is a SeaWing prince who is portrayed as smug and flirtatious, enjoying sweet-talking other dragons. He prioritizes relaxation and fun over his princely duties, a source of disappointment for his parents. He is seen as a troublemaker. Triton is expected to eventually take responsibility for his kingdom, a prospect he sometimes wishes to escape.\n\nHere are some of Triton's characteristics:\n*   **Personality:** He is described as attractive, flirtatious, and careless, but also charming, outgoing, and confident. He can also be playful, outspoken, protective, sarcastic, and smug. Negatively, he can be reactive, and haughty.\n*   **Trivia:** His parents often offer him potential partners, but he consistently declines, because he is gay. When angry, Triton's fins flare up, making him appear larger. He retains a typical teenager mindset and enjoys spending time with other dragons when he has the opportunity.\n*   **Upbringing**: From hatching, Triton was put on the path to be a perfect prince and future king. His father especially wanted him to be the best and strongest, conditioning him to meet this ideal, while his mother was gentler and more caring, though he was primarily raised by caretakers.\n*   In the French version of Wings of Fire, Turtle is translated to Triton.\n"

          "output": "Comet appears as a character in the *Wings of Fire* universe, with details varying based on fan-created content. Here's a summary of different interpretations:\n\n*   **Skywing OC:** One depiction of Comet is a male Skywing with yellow and orange scales, blue eyes, and ash-grey horns and talons. This character, created using an OC template by Axolotl, is described as bisexual with a nickname of Phoenix. He is said to have a yellow-red fade on his wing membranes with dark edges and golden veins. Personality-wise, he is considered protective, bitter, and aggressive.\n*   **Nightwing/Icewing Hybrid OC:** Another version of Comet is a Nightwing/Icewing hybrid. This character loves to read and is fascinated by Rainwings. He is shy, modest, and avoids conflict but will defend himself if necessary. Due to his Icewing heritage, his scales are dark blue instead of black, with light blue wings and underbelly. He was raised by a Nightwing hermit named Oathkeeper, who is secretly his grandfather, and later attends Jade Mountain Academy. Born under one moon, this Comet has weak foresight abilities that Oathkeeper tries to help him develop, though using them gives Comet headaches.\n*   **Nightwing with Skyfire Comet Influence:** A discussion on Reddit explores the idea of a Nightwing born during a skyfire comet pass. One user suggested such a dragon might have the ability to block mind readers and possess an amber-orange teardrop scale.\n"

She is raised in seclusion with Clay, Starflight, Sunny, and Tsunami.\n*   **Personality:** Initially, Glory is often perceived as bossy, cold, sarcastic, and self-centered. However, she is also portrayed as independent, persevering, loyal, and brave. She has a moderated sense of pride that gives her the courage to stand up for herself. Despite her initial reluctance, Glory is recognized as an important dragonet of destiny.\n*   **Appearance:** Glory has an elegant snout and a long, graceful body with soft wings. Although RainWings are known for their vibrant colors, Glory's color palette is more muted, reflecting her sardonic and cynical personality. She is described as pretty and beautiful by other dragons. RainWings scales usually shift between colors, depending on their mood. Glory's \"base color\" is her signature green and orange.\n*   **Abilities and Traits:** Glory, like other RainWings, can spit deadly venom from her fangs and use her tail to swing through trees. She can also change the color of her scales, allowing her to camouflage and mimic other dragon tribes.\n\n**Role in the Series:**\n\n*   **Dragonet of Destiny:** Glory is part of a prophecy to end a continent-wide war. She was a last-minute replacement for the original SkyWing egg.\n*   **Queen of the RainWings:** In the third book, *The Hidden Kingdom*, Glory challenges the RainWing queen for the throne and wins after Grandeur forfeits. She becomes the queen of the RainWings at a young age.\n*   **Queen of the NightWings:** After the fourth book, Glory becomes Queen of the NightWings as well. She allows the NightWings to live in the rainforest under her rule after the eruption of the Nightwing volcano.\n*   **Relationships:** Glory is in a relationship with Deathbringer. She is friends with the other dragonets of destiny, though she can be annoyed by Starflight's know-it-all personality. Kinkajou sees Glory as one of her best friends and admires her greatly.\n\n**Character Development:**\n\n*   **Overcoming Doubts:** Despite being doubted because of her origins, Glory adapts and turns negative thoughts into motivation.\n*   **Leadership and Bravery:** Glory demonstrates leadership and bravery, standing up for herself and her tribe. Her decision to attack Queen Scarlet with her venom in Book One is a key move that contributes to her character development.\n*   **Trust and Dependence:** As the series progresses, Glory learns to trust others more and realizes she doesn't always have to be self-reliant. She learns to depend on her friends and other RainWings.\n"

          "output": "The Meta Quest VR patch for *Civilization VII* released on July 10, 2025, aimed to improve game stability and performance. While specific technologies and algorithms used were not detailed in the patch notes, the update included the following fixes and improvements:\n*   Reduced visual flickering when panning across the map.\n*   Improved game stability and performance.\n*   Improved framerate during Diplomacy.\n*   Addressed reported freezing that could occur when interacting with Tech or Civics trees.\n*   Improved resource allocation in factories.\n\nPrior to this patch, players reported stuttering issues, which sometimes caused motion sickness, particularly in mixed reality mode. One potential fix identified by Ruff Talk VR involved changing the tracking frequency in Horizon OS settings from Automatic to 60 Hz. However, this solution may not work for everyone, and other unrelated performance issues were also reported. Some users also reported crashes upon startup.\n\nEarly reviews of *Civilization VII VR* indicated that the game pushed the Meta Quest 3 and 3S to their limits, with the game rendering at 36 frames per second, artificially doubled to 72 frames per second using Asynchronous Spacewarp. Dynamic resolution was also enabled, reducing resolution in graphically demanding scenes.\n\nGeneral optimization techniques for Meta Quest apps include:\n*   Identifying bottlenecks using frame debuggers like RenderDoc for Oculus.\n*   Simplifying complex geometry and reducing draw calls.\n*   Using Level of Detail (LOD) systems and batching draw calls.\n*   Optimizing CPU and GPU usage.\n*   Careful management of resolution, hardware resources, and image quality.\n*   Avoiding reliance on Asynchronous SpaceWarp (ASW) to hit the target frame rate.\n"

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on \"Hudson's Bay Canada latest news 2025\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nIn July 2025, Hudson's Bay Canada has ceased operations as a department store chain, marking the end of a 355-year history.\n\n**Key Developments:**\n\n*   **Liquidation and Store Closures:** Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) began liquidating its assets and closing stores after filing for creditor protection in March 2025. The final store closures occurred on June 1, 2025. Liquidation sales had exceeded the company's expectations.\n*   **Job Losses:** Approximately 8,347 employees, representing 89% of the workforce, were terminated by June 1, 2025, due to the store closures. An additional 899 employees were let go around June 15.\n*   **Financial Situation:** In early March 2025, HBC had approximately $3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Court filings indicated that the company was nearly $1 billion in debt. For the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2025, Hudson's Bay Canada had a net loss of approximately $329.7 million.\n*   **Creditor Protection:** An Ontario court extended Hudson's Bay's protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) to July 31, 2025.\n*   **Asset Sales:**\n    *   Canadian Tire acquired Hudson's Bay's intellectual property, including its trademarks and brand assets, for $30 million. The deal is set to close by July 15.\n    *   Ruby Liu, a B.C. billionaire, sought to acquire up to 25 Hudson's Bay leases to open a department store named after herself. However, she appeared in court without a lawyer, leading to an adjournment of the hearing. One of HBC's lenders, Restore Capital LLC, opposed the deal.\n*   **Strategic Alternatives:** Prior to the complete closure, HBC explored strategic options to preserve and boost its business. The company pursued an e-commerce strategy between 2021 and 2022, investing approximately $130 million.\n*   **Impact:** The closure of Hudson's Bay stores has left a void in major downtown cores across Canada.\n*   **Historical Context:** Founded in 1670, HBC was the oldest corporation in North America. The company's decline has been attributed to factors such as changing consumer behavior, increased competition from e-commerce, and insufficient investment in physical stores.\n"

          "output": "Here's a breakdown of the mechanisms of action of valiltramiprosate, AR1001, and remternetug in treating Alzheimer's disease, and their potential advantages over existing treatments like donanemab and lecanemab:\n\n**1. Valiltramiprosate (ALZ-801)**\n\n*   **Mechanism of Action:** Valiltramiprosate is an oral prodrug of tramiprosate. Its active metabolites, including tramiprosate and 3-sulfopropanoic acid, bind to amyloid-beta (Aβ42) monomers. This binding stabilizes the monomers, preventing their aggregation and oligomerization into toxic oligomers, which are believed to be a key driver of Alzheimer's disease. Valiltramiprosate's mechanism of action involves multiple molecules binding to amyloid monomers, stabilizing their shape and blocking the formation of neurotoxic oligomers.\n*   **Potential Advantages:**\n    *   **Oral Administration:** Valiltramiprosate is administered orally, offering a more convenient route compared to the intravenous infusions required for donanemab and lecanemab.\n    *   **Safety Profile:** Valiltramiprosate has not been associated with an increased risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a known side effect of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies like donanemab and lecanemab.\n    *   **Targeting APOE4 Homozygotes:** Valiltramiprosate is being investigated for its potential in APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes, a population at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and ARIA, and for whom some regulators limit the use of donanemab and lecanemab.\n    *   **Early Intervention:** Valiltramiprosate acts early in the amyloid cascade, targeting the formation of soluble amyloid aggregates, unlike donanemab and lecanemab, which target insoluble plaques.\n    *   **Neuroprotection:** Valiltramiprosate has demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects, including brain structure preservation and reduced hippocampal atrophy.\n*   **Efficacy:**\n    *   A Phase III trial in APOE ε4 homozygotes did not meet its primary endpoint. However, a pre-specified analysis of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subgroup showed significant benefits on cognitive assessments.\n    *   In the MCI population, valiltramiprosate treatment also resulted in significant improvements in Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) score, and clinically meaningful effects were also seen across the Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, and Amsterdam – Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (A-IADL) scores.\n    *   Imaging also revealed nominally significant reductions in brain shrinkage in MCI patients.\n\n**2. AR1001**\n\n*   **Mechanism of Action:** AR1001 is a highly selective phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. It increases levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and activates the cGMP/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) cascade, promoting neuronal cell survival. AR1001 also downregulates Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) transcriptional activity, reducing the expression of APP, BACE1, and Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1). Additionally, AR1001 has been shown to disrupt pre-formed Aβ42 fibrils in vitro and reduce Aβ plaque deposition by activating autophagy.\n*   **Potential Advantages:**\n    *   **Polypharmacological Agent:** AR1001 acts through multiple mechanisms, including promoting neuronal cell survival and inhibiting Aβ accumulation.\n    *   **Oral Administration:** AR1001 is an orally available drug.\n    *   **Blood Brain Barrier Penetration:** AR1001 has superior blood brain barrier penetrance.\n    *   **Safety:** AR1001 was well-tolerated in a yearlong clinical trial in AD patients.\n*   **Efficacy:**\n    *   AR1001 has shown potential evidence of promoting neuronal cell survival in AD during early-stage studies.\n    *   AR1001 significantly increased hippocampal cGMP and BDNF at doses of 6 and 9 mg/kg QD.\n    *   AR1001 had pronounced effects in recovery of cognitive functions in a transgenic mouse model of AD at a dose equivalent to that being tested in the Phase 3 trial in early AD patients.\n    *   AR1001 was associated with a decrease in p-tau 181 levels.\n\n**3. Remternetug**\n\n*   **Mechanism of Action:** Remternetug is a monoclonal antibody designed to target and remove aggregated amyloid plaques, a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, via microglial-mediated clearance. It binds to a specific region of the toxic amyloid protein, attracting immune cells to clear the plaques. Remternetug targets N-terminal pyroglutamated Aβ.\n*   **Potential Advantages:**\n    *   **Effective Plaque Removal:** Remternetug has demonstrated the ability to reduce brain amyloid plaque. Some data suggests it may provide more robust plaque removal than donanemab.\n    *   **Subcutaneous Dosing:** Remternetug is being tested in clinical trials for both intravenous and subcutaneous administration, potentially offering a more convenient option than intravenous infusions.\n*   **Efficacy:**\n    *   Early trial data suggests significant amyloid plaque clearance within six months.\n    *   In one study, 75% of participants treated with remternetug had amyloid cleared from their brains after 6 months, compared to 40% in a donanemab trial.\n*   **Safety:**\n    *   Remternetug is associated with ARIA, including brain swelling.\n\n**4. Donanemab and Lecanemab**\n\n*   **Mechanism of Action:** Donanemab and lecanemab are monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. Lecanemab selectively binds to soluble Aβ protofibrils, reducing Aβ protofibrils and amyloid plaques. Donanemab targets a modified form of amyloid-beta found only in plaques, promoting plaque removal through microglial-mediated phagocytosis.\n*   **Donanemab vs Lecanemab:** Lecanemab targets amyloid as it begins to form fibers, while donanemab binds to amyloid once these fibers have clumped together to become a larger plaque.\n*   **Common Side Effects:** The most common side effects of lecanemab and donanemab include headache, infusion-related reactions, and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).\n*   **Efficacy:** Both drugs have demonstrated modest efficacy in reducing cognitive decline compared to placebo in clinical trials.\n*   **Limitations:**\n    *   **Administration:** Both donanemab and lecanemab are administered intravenously.\n    *   **Safety:** Both drugs are associated with ARIA. APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes are at the highest risk of ARIAs.\n    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** NICE has not recommended lecanemab for use on the NHS due to its high cost and limited benefits.\n\n**5. Advantages of Valiltramiprosate, AR1001, and Remternetug**\n\n*   **Valiltramiprosate and AR1001 (Oral Administration):** Offer a more convenient route of administration compared to the intravenous infusions required for donanemab and lecanemab.\n*   **Valiltramiprosate (Safety Profile):** Has not been associated with an increased risk of ARIA, a known side effect of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies like donanemab and lecanemab.\n*   **Remternetug (Efficacy):** May provide more robust plaque removal than donanemab.\n*   **Valiltramiprosate (Targeting APOE4 Homozygotes):** Being investigated for its potential in APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes, a population at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and ARIA, and for whom some regulators limit the use of donanemab and lecanemab.\n*   **AR1001 (Polypharmacological Agent):** Acts through multiple mechanisms, including promoting neuronal cell survival and inhibiting Aβ accumulation.\n"

      "ai_message": "It appears you're encountering issues with the LMSYS Arena, specifically with short code snippets generating errors that didn't occur previously. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and factors to consider, based on information available as of July 16, 2025:\n\n**1. Input Length and Context Limitations:**\n\nWhile the underlying models in the LMSYS Arena, such as Gemma 3 and others, can have large context windows (up to 128k tokens for some Gemma 3 variants [huggingface](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-11) and even 10 million tokens claimed for Llama 4 Scout [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5)), there might be practical limitations imposed by the platform itself. A Reddit post from 2023 mentioned a 400-word limit [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6), and while it's unclear if this *specific* limit is still in place, it's possible that input length is being restricted to ensure fair comparisons between models or to manage computational costs [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8) [lmsys](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n\n**2. Code Execution Environment and Common Errors (WebDev Arena):**\n\nIf you're using the WebDev Arena, which focuses on React, TypeScript, and Tailwind development [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2), several common issues could be at play [lmarena](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3):\n\n*   **Hallucinated Libraries/Missing Imports:** The model might be trying to use libraries that don't exist or haven't been imported.  Make sure all React imports (like `useState` or `useEffect`) are explicitly imported [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2).\n*   **Incorrect Dependency Installation:**  The necessary dependencies might not be installed correctly.  Ensure all dependencies are specified and installed properly [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2).\n*   **Non-Compiling Code:** The generated code might simply have bugs that prevent it from compiling [lmarena](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n*   **Incorrect Formatting:** The code needs to be returned in the correct format, starting with the imports and containing *only* the React code, without any surrounding text like  `` `typescript` `` or  `` `javascript` `` [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [lmarena](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n*   **Modifying Project Dependency Files:** The model should *not* be altering files like `package.json` [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [simonwillison](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [lmarena](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n\n**3. Sandboxing and Security:**\n\nThe LMSYS Arena uses a sandboxed environment with microVMs to isolate code execution [lmarena](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0). This environment, while secure, could introduce limitations or unexpected behavior. The WebDev Arena uses Amazon's Firecracker microVM technology through E2B's infrastructure [lmarena](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0). Each sandbox runs in a lightweight virtual machine, providing enhanced security and workload isolation [lmarena](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0).\n\n**4. Potential Bugs and Platform Evolution:**\n\nThe LMSYS Arena is a constantly evolving platform. It's possible that recent updates or changes have introduced new bugs or altered the way code is processed. A GitHub issue from February 2025 mentions an \"ERROR\" on the LMSYS arena [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5), which could be related to the issues you're seeing.\n\n**5. Model-Specific Issues:**\n\nDifferent models within the arena might have varying levels of proficiency in code generation and adherence to the required environment. Some models might be more prone to errors or exhibit unexpected behavior with certain code patterns.\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n*   **Simplify Your Code:** Start with the most basic code snippet possible to isolate the issue.\n*   **Check for Common Errors:** Carefully review your code for the common errors listed above (missing imports, incorrect formatting, etc.).\n*   **Review the LMSYS Arena Documentation:** Look for any recent updates or changes to the platform that might explain the new behavior.\n*   **Report the Issue:** If you suspect a bug in the LMSYS Arena, report it to the platform developers.\n*   **Consider Model Limitations:** Try different models within the arena to see if the issue is specific to a particular model.\n\nWithout more specific information about the error messages you're receiving, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. However, by considering these factors and troubleshooting steps, you should be able to narrow down the problem and find a solution.",

          "output": "While the search results don't provide a list of specific error messages encountered when running short code snippets in the LMSYS Arena WebDev environment, they do offer insights into the environment, potential issues, and how models are evaluated.\n\nHere's a synthesis of the findings:\n\n*   **LMSYS WebDev Arena Overview:** The LMSYS WebDev Arena is a platform for evaluating how well different AI models perform in web development tasks. It's a real-time AI coding competition where models generate web applications based on user prompts. Users can vote on which model performs better, contributing to a live leaderboard. The WebDev Arena focuses on building interactive web applications, primarily using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. The resulting code is rendered in iframes using the E2B sandboxing platform.\n\n*   **Structured Output Approach:** To ensure consistent and deployable web applications, the WebDev Arena uses a structured output approach, which constrains the LLM's output to match a specific structure, typically a JSON schema. This approach offers type safety and eliminates the need to validate incorrectly formatted responses.\n\n*   **Common Issues and Errors:**\n\n    *   **Hallucinated Libraries/Missing Imports:** Models may attempt to use libraries that don't exist or haven't been imported. If React imports like `useState` or `useEffect` are used, they must be imported directly.\n    *   **Incorrect Dependency Installation:** Models can fail to properly install necessary dependencies. All additional dependencies must be specified and installed.\n    *   **Non-Compiling Code:** The generated code may contain bugs or errors that prevent it from compiling.\n    *   **Incorrect Formatting:** Models might not return code in the expected format, such as including unnecessary surrounding text (e.g., starting with ```typescript or ```javascript). The models should only return the full React code, starting with the imports.\n    *   **Use of Arbitrary Values:** The models are instructed not to use arbitrary values for styling (e.g., `h-[600px]`) and to use a consistent color palette.\n    *   **Modifying Project Dependency Files:** Models should not alter project dependency files like `package.json` or `requirements.txt`.\n    *   **\"Both Bad\" Votes:** A significant number of \"both bad\" votes occur when models fail, either by hallucinating a library or producing code that cannot compile.\n\n*   **Debugging and Model Performance:** Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrates impressive autonomous coding capabilities, including drafting code, running tests, and iteratively revising solutions. It excels in fast-paced, iterative coding scenarios.\n\n*   **Limitations of WebDev Arena:** The WebDev Arena is primarily focused on Next.js-based React applications, excluding other frameworks and backend technologies. It may not fully represent complex, multi-turn conversations or niche coding tasks. The prompts used in the arena might be simple, everyday queries rather than difficult debugging problems.\n\n*   **Leaderboard Ranking:** The WebDev Arena uses the Bradley-Terry (BT) model to rank LLMs based on their real-world coding performance. This system is similar to the Elo rating system used in chess.\n\nIt's important to note that the WebDev Arena is constantly evolving, and the specific error messages and their frequencies may change as the platform and the models improve.\n"

          "output": "While I don't have specific information about bugs or limitations causing errors with short code snippets in the LMSYS Arena's code execution environment, here's a summary of related information from the search results:\n\n1.  **General Benchmarking and Evaluation in LMSYS Arena:**\n    *   LMSYS Arena is a platform for live, open, and community-driven evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs). It uses pairwise comparisons based on human preferences to rank models.\n    *   The platform aims to address the limitations of static benchmarks, which can be prone to contamination.\n    *   LMSYS acknowledges that evaluating models at or above the strength of GPT-4 is challenging for humans.\n2.  **Code Execution and Related Features:**\n    *   LMSYS Arena is expanding beyond text to include specialized domains like code execution.\n    *   The platform supports code completion and editing functionalities. Copilot Arena, a part of LMSYS, provides code edit suggestions and allows users to vote between them.\n    *   Users can engage in activities such as writing/building code, resolving errors, optimizing code, code translation, and testing code within the Arena.\n3.  **Potential Issues and Biases:**\n    *   LLM judges can exhibit biases such as verbosity bias (favoring longer responses). LMSYS has introduced methods to control for such biases.\n    *   There can be a lack of detailed logs for debugging.\n    *   The leaderboard rankings may not always align with the perceived strength of models due to factors like \"slop\" (superficial optimization). LMSYS has introduced statistical controls to address this.\n4.  **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   Multiple code execution vulnerabilities have been reported in Rockwell Automation Arena, potentially allowing threat actors to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious files. These vulnerabilities include \"out of bounds read/write\" and \"uninitialized variable\" issues. Exploitation typically requires a legitimate user to execute the malicious code.\n5.  **Limitations with Large Datasets:**\n    *   Some sources mention that code interpreters, in general, may struggle with large datasets.\n\nIt is important to note that while the search results mention code execution capabilities and potential issues within the Arena, they do not specifically address whether there are known bugs or limitations that *specifically* cause errors with *short* code snippets.\n"

          "output": "The LMSYS Arena employs several sandboxing and security measures to protect its code execution environment. These measures primarily aim to isolate user-submitted code and prevent malicious activities.\n\n**Sandboxing and Security Measures:**\n\n*   **MicroVM Technology:** The WebDev Arena utilizes Amazon's Firecracker microVM technology through E2B's infrastructure.\n*   **Lightweight Virtual Machines:** Each sandbox runs in a lightweight virtual machine, providing enhanced security and workload isolation. This maintains resource efficiency similar to containers.\n*   **Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM):** These microVMs are managed by a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) using the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).\n*   **Minimalist Design:** The microVMs have a minimalist design that excludes unnecessary devices and functionality to reduce memory footprint and the attack surface.\n*   **Complete Isolation:** This infrastructure allows the WebDev Arena to run thousands of concurrent LLM-generated applications with complete isolation. Each application operates in its own secure environment with dedicated CPU, memory, and networking.\n*   **NSFW Detection:** The platform uses an NSFW moderation filter for images, requiring the AZURE\\_IMG\\_MODERATION\\_ENDPOINT and AZURE\\_IMG\\_MODERATION\\_API\\_KEY environment variables to be set.\n*   **Data Security:** Reasonable and suitable measures are used to prevent unauthorized access to Competition Data. Participants agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute, or otherwise make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition.\n*   **Vote Limitations:** The system limits the number of votes per IP address per day to prevent abuse.\n*   **Prompt Deduplication:** Overly frequent prompts are deduplicated to ensure a diverse dataset.\n\n**How These Measures Affect User-Submitted Code Execution:**\n\n*   **Isolation:** The sandboxing environment ensures that user-submitted code cannot directly access the host system or other applications running on the same server. This prevents malicious code from compromising the entire system.\n*   **Resource Limits:** The dedicated CPU, memory, and networking resources allocated to each sandbox limit the potential damage from resource-intensive or denial-of-service attacks.\n*   **Restricted Functionality:** The minimalist design of the microVMs reduces the attack surface by removing unnecessary functionality that could be exploited.\n*   **Monitoring and Control:** The platform logs all user interactions. Statistical methods and optional user login systems are planned to enhance security.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   The LMSYS Chatbot Arena offers a research preview with limited security measures, which may generate inappropriate content, thus requiring users to adhere to specific terms of use.\n*   The platform is open source, which means that anyone can clone, audit, or run another instance of Chatbot Arena to produce a similar leaderboard.\n*   The evaluation process, including rating computation, identifying anomalous users, and LLM selection, are all made publicly available.\n*   The platform also employs vote limitations and prompt deduplication to prevent abuse and ensure a diverse dataset.\n*   LMSYS is planning to introduce further defenses, such as statistical methods and optional user login systems, to enhance security.\n"

This ruling challenges the practice of anonymous reviews.\n*   **Employer's Right to Know:** The court ruled that employers should be able to ascertain if they ever had a relationship with the person posting a negative review.\n*   **Federal Court of Justice Requirements:** German's Federal Court of Justice states that review services must investigate potentially false comments by acquiring proof that the user works or has worked for the reviewed company.\n*   **Kununu's Response:** Kununu has expressed disagreement with court decisions that require them to reveal reviewer identities and has taken legal action against such rulings.\n\n**Kununu's Actions:**\n\n*   **Investigation of Complaints:** Kununu employs a team to investigate complaints, particularly those concerning slander and false statements.\n*   **Demanding Evidence:** When employers question a review's authenticity, Kununu demands evidence.\n*   **Contacting Review Authors:** Kununu contacts review authors and requests anonymized proof of their employment.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Balancing Anonymity and Authenticity:** Kununu faces the challenge of balancing user privacy with the need to ensure review authenticity.\n*   **Adapting Policies:** Review platforms need to adapt their policies and procedures to ensure both privacy and legality.\n*   **Potential for Legal Consequences:** Reviewers may face legal consequences for untruthful reviews.\n*   **Difficulties in Appeasing Employers:** It's becoming increasingly difficult for job sites to appease both candidates/reviewers and employers.\n\n**It is important to note that:**\n\n*   Some users believe that Kununu deletes negative reviews at the request of employers.\n*   There are concerns about fake positive reviews being posted.\n*   Kununu carefully screens the content of all reviews, which is why in some cases reviews may not be released for publication.\n"

Free APIs often have rate limits and token limits [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). To mitigate these, projects can be broken into smaller chunks, and users can switch between API providers [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). Performance can also vary among free APIs, and some models may struggle with complex tasks [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8). It's crucial to monitor API usage costs, as they can unexpectedly increase [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9).\n\nTo effectively cycle through free API providers in RooCode, consider the following techniques:\n\n*   **API Provider Configuration & Management:** RooCode allows creating and managing different API configurations for various providers [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0).\n*   **API Gateways & Proxies:** Utilize OpenRouter, Requesty, or Portkey to access multiple LLMs through a single API endpoint, providing fallback mechanisms and load balancing [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [requesty](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3) [portkey](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4).\n*   **Rate Limit Handling:** Implement a script to track API usage, automatically switch to backup APIs, and use exponential backoff for errors [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6).\n*   **Token Management:** Optimize prompts, limit tool calls, and use models with caching to reduce token usage [requesty](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-9).\n\nAdditional strategies include using clear and specific prompts, codebase indexing, caching, and multi-file reading to optimize API usage [apidog](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on \"challenges of cycling through free APIs for roocode provider July 2025\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nBased on the search results, here's a summary of the challenges of cycling through free APIs for a \"roocode provider\" in July 2025:\n\n**General Challenges with Free APIs:**\n\n*   **Rate Limits:** Free APIs often have strict rate limits, which can cause 429 errors if exceeded. This means there's a cap on the number of requests you can make within a certain time frame.\n*   **Token Limits:** AI models also have token limits, restricting the amount of text processed in a single request.\n*   **Licensing Restrictions:** Some APIs, like Google Maps Geocoding API, have restrictive terms, such as not allowing permanent storage of geocoding results outside their ecosystem.\n*   **Reliability:** Free APIs might be subject to outages or changes in access policies that are outside of your control.\n*   **Cost:** While the API itself might be free, you may still incur costs from the underlying AI models used.\n*   **Training Data:** Some providers may use your API requests to train their models.\n\n**Specific Challenges with RooCode and Free APIs:**\n\n*   **RooCode Gemini Limitations:** While RooCode offers Gemini 2.5 Pro integration for free, it may still hit limits. Complex apps might need to be broken into smaller chunks.\n*   **API Key Management:** RooCode requires API keys for the LLMs it uses. While RooCode itself is free, you need to obtain and manage API keys from providers like Google (Gemini) or OpenRouter.\n*   **Model Selection:** Choosing the right AI model for different tasks within RooCode is important to optimize performance and cost. For example, stronger reasoning models like Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview or Deepseek R1 are recommended for \"Architect Mode,\" while other models are better for code generation or debugging.\n*   **Integration Issues:** There can be issues related to the Roo Code integration with certain models. For example, there were past issues with Anthropic/Claude integration due to outdated model identifiers, requiring updates to the configuration.\n*   **External Access Model:** Roo Code's LLM integration can be blocked by external access models.\n\n**Strategies for Mitigating Challenges:**\n\n*   **Switching Providers:** If you hit a limit with one provider, switch to another. RooCode supports multiple providers, including OpenRouter.\n*   **Project Scoping:** Keep projects reasonably scoped to avoid hitting token limits.\n*   **Iterative Improvement:** Use the chat feature to iteratively improve designs.\n*   **Smaller Subtasks:** Break down tasks into smaller subtasks and start new chats to manage context.\n*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce redundant requests.\n*   **Monitoring Usage:** Track API usage to monitor and adjust limits dynamically.\n*   **Optimize Prompts:** Refine system prompts to improve the quality and efficiency of the generated code.\n*   **Use Different Models for Different Tasks:** Assign different models to different modes within RooCode to optimize performance and cost.\n*   **Consider Paid Options:** If free options are too limiting, consider affordable subscriptions or pay-as-you-go options.\n*   **Leverage Free Credits:** Some platforms, like Google Cloud, offer free credits for initial use.\n*   **Key-Level Rate Limiting:** Assign limits per API key with tiered options for different user types.\n\n**Alternatives to RooCode:**\n\n*   **CodeConductor.ai:** A full-stack platform for building, orchestrating, and deploying AI-powered applications at scale, offering features like persistent memory and visual multi-agent workflows.\n*   **KiloCode:** A fork of RooCode with a streamlined UI and \"Kilocomplete\" feature for real-time autocomplete.\n*   **Gemini Code Assist:** A free AI coding assistant developed by Google.\n*   **Cline:** Another VS Code extension for AI-assisted programming.\n*   **Cursor:** An AI code editor with unified request-based pricing.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The information available is constantly evolving. The search results reflect information up to July 16, 2025, but changes in API policies, pricing, and model availability can occur.\n*   Some sources may promote specific products or services. Consider the source's perspective when evaluating the information.\n"

          "output": "To effectively switch between multiple free API providers in RooCode and avoid rate limits and token limits, consider these techniques:\n\n**1. API Provider Configuration & Management**\n\n*   **Multiple API Configurations:** RooCode allows you to create, edit, and delete different API configurations for different providers and models. You can rename the default configuration to be more descriptive.\n*   **Provider Selection:** RooCode supports various API providers like OpenRouter, Anthropic, Glama, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, and GCP Vertex. It also supports OpenAI-compatible APIs and local models through LM Studio/Ollama.\n*   **Dynamic Switching:** Implement logic to dynamically select the best LLM based on cost, availability, and performance.\n\n**2. Using API Gateways & Proxies**\n\n*   **OpenRouter:** Use OpenRouter as a proxy server to access multiple LLMs through a single API endpoint. OpenRouter can route requests based on availability, performance, and cost, distributing the load and reducing the chance of hitting rate limits for a single provider. It also provides fallback mechanisms.\n*   **Requesty:** Integrate RooCode with Requesty to access 150+ LLMs through a single API key. Requesty offers fallback policies, load balancing, and failover capabilities.\n*   **Portkey:** Use Portkey as a centralized AI Gateway to provide visibility, control, and security. Portkey offers a unified interface for 1600+ LLMs and allows dynamic routing to the most efficient or cost-effective model.\n*   **MakeHub.ai:** Integrate MakeHub.ai as an AI provider within RooCode. MakeHub.ai offers a high-speed LLM API that performs real-time speed and price arbitrage across multiple providers.\n\n**3. Rate Limit Handling Techniques**\n\n*   **Rate Limit Management Script:** Create a script to track API usage across providers, automatically switch to backup APIs when limits are approached, and use exponential backoff for 429 errors.\n*   **Implement Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms and error handling to ensure robustness. The most common rate limit error is 429.\n*   **Adjust Rate Limit Parameters:** Adjust chunk size, embedding model, or LLM to reduce the number of API calls if you consistently encounter rate limits.\n*   **Monitor API Usage:** Keep track of your API usage through the API provider's dashboard to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize your application.\n*   **Implement Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data and reduce the number of API calls. You can cache embeddings, LLM responses, or retrieved context.\n*   **Queuing:** Use a message queue to handle API requests asynchronously, smoothing out traffic spikes and preventing rate limits from being exceeded.\n*   **Consider API Rate Limits in Code:** If HTTP Header included the rate limit handle information, use these values instead of the static rateLimitSeconds.\n\n**4. Token Management**\n\n*   **Token Optimization:** Lower your prompt token count to save money on every request.\n*   **Memory Bank Optimization:** Optimize the memory-bank to split up in days.\n*   **Limit Tool Calls:** Limit tool calls and use shorter conversations.\n*   **Use Model with Caching:** Use a model with caching (e.g., Gemini 2.5, Claude, GPT-4.1-mini).\n*   **Strategic Model Selection:** Use more expensive models to architect your code and write your development plan, and cheaper models like gpt 4.1-mini or gemini-2.5-flash for implementation.\n*   **System Prompt Optimization:** Roo Code often uses a detailed system prompt, which can be optimized to reduce token usage.\n\n**5. Code Examples and Strategies**\n\n*   **API Key Management:** Store API keys securely and use environment variables to access them.\n*   **Boomerang Tasks:** Use RooCode's Boomerang Tasks to chain API calls.\n*   **Custom Modes:** Create custom modes with tailored prompts and specify file restrictions.\n*    **Rate Limiting Logic (JavaScript):**\n    ```javascript\n    const apiQueue = new Map([\n      ['gemini', { count: 0, lastReset: Date.now() }],\n      ['claude', { count: 0, lastReset: Date.now() }]\n    ]);\n    ```\n*   **.clinerules Files:** Use `.clinerules` files in your project root to manage settings.\n\n**6. Additional Tips**\n\n*   **Monitor Response Times:** Implement monitoring to track the response times of your API requests.\n*   **Quality Optimization Techniques:** Use prompt engineering and temperature tuning to optimize output quality.\n*   **Workspace-Specific Settings:** Create client rules file for workspace-specific custom instructions.\n*   **Checkpoints:** Use checkpoints to rollback changes when needed.\n*   **Multi-File Reading:** Use multi-file reading feature to allow AI models to analyze multiple files simultaneously.\n*   **Tool Loop Detection:** Use tool loop detection to prevent infinite loops.\n\nBy implementing these techniques, you can effectively switch between multiple free API providers in RooCode, avoid rate limits and token limits, and optimize your AI-assisted development workflow.\n"

Launched initially in the late 1970s, it utilizes advanced optics, imaging sensors, and stabilization systems to capture detailed images of the Earth's surface. As of 2025, while specific technical details remain largely classified, several aspects of its technology and capabilities can be inferred from available information.\n\n**Design and Technology:**\n\n*   **Optical System:** KH-11 satellites are believed to resemble the Hubble Space Telescope in size and shape. The initial KH-11 satellites had a primary mirror of 2.34 meters in diameter, with later versions increasing to around 2.9 to 3.1 meters. The design incorporates a Cassegrain reflecting telescope system, where the secondary mirror can be moved to capture images from various angles.\n*   **Imaging Sensors:** The KH-11 was the first American spy satellite to use electro-optical digital imaging and offer real-time optical observations. The initial sensor was an array of light-sensitive diodes, but later models switched to a charge-coupled device (CCD). KH-11 Block II might have been the first reconnaissance satellite equipped for imaging with an 800 × 800 pixels CCD. Later versions may also have signals intelligence capabilities and greater sensitivity in broader light spectrums, including infrared.\n*   **Data Transmission:** The recorded digital signal is encrypted and transmitted to a ground station in near real-time. Communication and data downloads are routed through a constellation of communication relay satellites. The initial communications relay payload is believed to have operated at a frequency of 60 GHz.\n*   **Size and Mass:** KH-11 satellites are approximately 19.5 meters in length and up to 3 meters in diameter. The mass varies between versions, with early KH-11s around 12,000 kg, and later blocks ranging from 17,000 kg to 19,600 kg.\n\n**Resolution and Capabilities:**\n\n*   The KH-11 satellites provide images with spatial resolution reaching a few centimeters. While the theoretical resolution could reach 6 cm at an altitude of 250 kilometers, atmospheric turbulence likely degrades the operational resolution to around 10 cm. Some sources suggest a best-case ground resolution of 15 cm or better.\n*   The large mirror size enables the identification of objects as small as 10 cm across.\n*   The satellites are capable of \"SatSquared\" imaging, allowing them to capture images of other spacecraft from great distances.\n\n**Operational Aspects:**\n\n*   KH-11 satellites orbit at altitudes between 250 and 500 kilometers.\n*   They are placed in sun-synchronous orbits in two orbital planes, separated by about 50 degrees of longitude. This configuration allows for observations in both morning and afternoon hours, utilizing shadows to enhance the height profile of structures.\n*   The satellites are launched atop Titan IV and Atlas V rockets from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n*   As of June 2025, the alleged \"Block 5\" satellites, including USA-290, USA-314, and USA-338, are still in orbit.\n\n**Evolution and Upgrades:**\n\n*   Successive generations of KH-11 satellites, such as \"Improved Crystal\" or \"Advanced Crystal\" satellites, incorporate advancements in imaging technology, sensor resolution, and data processing capabilities.\n*   Later satellites, referred to as KH-11B or KH-12, feature improvements like the \"Improved Metric CRYSTAL System\" (IMCS), which adds reference markers to photos for precise geolocation.\n*   The latest generation of electro-optical satellites is referred to as the Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System.\n"

A European Space Agency (ESA) project aims to achieve imagery every 20 to 30 minutes. KH-11 satellites are placed in sun-synchronous orbits, and a complete constellation consists of at least 4 satellites. This suggests a revisit time of a few hours or less for key areas, potentially improved with the addition of new satellites in 2025.\n*   **Swath Width:** In the 1960s, Corona could image a swath 150 nm wide, while HEXAGON had the capability to image a swath 300 nm wide. While specific swath widths for KH-11 in 2025 are unavailable, it can be assumed that it is at least as wide as HEXAGON, if not wider.\n*   **Data Latency:** KH-11 was the first near-real-time reconnaissance satellite capable of transmitting imagery nearly instantaneously. Data is transmitted to ground stations using Satellite Data System (SDS) communication satellites. By 2025, real-time tactical intelligence is a necessity for military commanders. Therefore, KH-11 likely has a data latency of only minutes.\n*   **Resolution:** The best-case ground resolution of KH-11 is expected to be in the order of 15 cm (6 in) or better. Images of a damaged launch pad in Iran taken by a KH-11 satellite had a ground resolution of 10 cm. Commercial satellite imagery will offer 10 cm resolution in early 2025.\n\n**Comparison to Other US Reconnaissance Assets:**\n\n*   The Space Force will add over 100 satellites in 2025 to improve reconnaissance capabilities.\n*   The U.S. Department of Defense and Intelligence Community spend an estimated $40–50+ billion annually on military and reconnaissance satellites.\n*   The U.S. military is fielding proliferated space architectures to support surveillance and reconnaissance.\n*   BlackSky operates a commercial constellation that delivers 35-centimeter resolution imagery at very low latency, with global revisit rates of under 90 minutes.\n*   The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) procures data from commercial imaging satellite operators.\n\n**Comparison to Competitor Systems:**\n\n*   China's Yaogan satellite series is used primarily for military purposes, providing real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.\n*   Europe is developing a new reconnaissance satellite constellation aimed at enhancing the security of EU member states, with imagery expected every 20 to 30 minutes once operational.\n*   BAE Systems and Hanwha Systems are jointly developing an advanced multi-sensor satellite system that will combine data from both RF and SAR satellites and exploit machine learning to deliver precise, timely, and high-resolution intelligence.\n*   From 2023 to 2025, there is expected to be a surge in launches of U.S. military serial small satellites with new developed ISR technologies.\n"

These satellites may include capabilities like target tracking, optical and radio reconnaissance, and early missile warning. \n *   **AI Integration:** There is a move towards integrating AI for on-board autonomy to manage observations and respond to situations autonomously. \n\n **Orbital Characteristics:** \n\n *   **Low Earth Orbit (LEO):** The trend is towards deploying more satellites in LEO. \n *   **Sun-Synchronous Orbits:** KH-11 satellites are typically placed in Sun-synchronous orbits. \n *   **Inclined Geosynchronous Orbits:** New generation communication satellites are being launched to inclined geosynchronous orbits, possibly in support of electro-optical satellites. \n\n **KH-11 Replacements and Evolution:** \n\n *   **Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System:** Official budget documents refer to the latest generation of electro-optical satellites as the Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System. \n *   **KH-11 Successors:** While specific details are scarce, the NRO has launched newer spacecraft since 2011 and plans to launch more, suggesting a continuous evolution and replacement of older KH-11 satellites. \n\n **Points of Interest:** \n\n *   **Russian ASAT Concerns:** There are concerns about Russian satellites potentially being developed as co-orbital anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. These satellites shadow U.S. government satellites, particularly those believed to be KH-series reconnaissance satellites. \n *   **Commercial Imagery:**  Commercial providers of electro-optical and SAR imagery are playing an increasing role, with companies like Planet Labs, Maxar, ICEYE, and Capella Space providing data to the NRO.\n"

          "output": "The search for a \"permissive licensed RPG system for sexual encounters\" reveals a complex landscape of tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) licenses, systems, and community attitudes towards sexual content. Here's a breakdown of the findings:\n\n**1. Open Game Licenses (OGL) and Permissive Systems**\n\n*   **d20 System and OGL:** The d20 System, originally developed for Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition, was released under the Open Game License (OGL). This allows commercial and non-commercial publishers to create modifications or supplements to the system without paying for intellectual property rights. However, Wizards of the Coast (WotC) can exert discretionary power over what counts as legitimate d20 material.\n*   **Cypher System Open License (CSOL):** The Cypher System Open License (CSOL) allows publishers, gamers, and members of the public to freely create and publish tabletop roleplaying games compatible with, and using the rules from, the Cypher System.\n*   **Open RPG Creative License (ORC):** The ORC License grants the right to use Licensed Material subject to the terms and conditions set forth and referenced.\n*   **Year Zero Engine Free Tabletop Licence (FTL):** The Year Zero Engine Free Tabletop Licence (FTL) gives all creators an irrevocable, worldwide, and royalty-free right to use the Year Zero Engine Standard Reference Document (YZE SRD) and freely publish their own roleplaying games based on it.\n*   **Savage Worlds:** There are currently four ways to use the Savage Worlds game system for your own materials: the unapproved Fan license, the Savage Worlds Adventurer's Guild, the Media Network Content license, and the official license for Aces.\n\n**2. Sexual Content in RPGs**\n\n*   **Community Standards:** Wizards of the Coast changed the d20 license to require publications to meet \"community standards of decency\". This was prompted by the announcement of the sexually explicit *Book of Erotic Fantasy*.\n*   **Explicit Content:** Mainstream TTRPGs, such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), have generally avoided explicit sexual content in their texts.\n*   **Emergence of Adult Themes:** Small publishing companies and independent authors have created games that embrace sexually violent themes.\n*   **Tools for Player Comfort:** Tools like \"the X card\" allow players to instantly shut down any uncomfortable role-playing situations.\n*   **Mature Handling:** The *Book of Erotic Fantasy* handles the subject of sex in a mature and well-thought-out manner.\n\n**3. Specific RPGs with Mature Themes**\n\n*   **Monsterhearts 2:** Each playbook has a unique sex move, and one of the character moves is \"turn someone on\". It's all about hormonal and horny angsty teenage monsters.\n*   **Unknown Armies 3e:** You can play as a pornomancer, or as an avatar of the living embodiment of lust.\n*   **World of Darkness (e.g., Vampire the Masquerade):** The books are firmly 18+ and being a vampire can get pretty twisted.\n*   **Honey and Hot Wax:** A game anthology that is all about sex.\n\n**4. Licensing Considerations**\n\n*   **System vs. Brand:** It's important to note the distinction between licensing a system and a brand. You can use the d20 system, but you can't claim your module is for D&D 3.5 without permission.\n*   **\"Community Standards\":** Be aware of \"community standards\" when publishing content, especially sexually explicit content.\n*   **Professional Advice:** If you are serious about making money off an OGL game you've made, it's probably worth hiring a professional to help you guard yourself in case they decide to make a claim.\n\n**5. Permissive Play**\n\n*   **Definition:** Permissive play involves players making statements rather than asking questions, with anything not explicitly stated being open for other players to fill in.\n*   **Focus on Story:** Permissive rules require you to treat the story, the table conversation, as primary and the game world as derived.\n\n**6. Cautions and Considerations**\n\n*   **Player Comfort:** Sexual content rarely works in RPGs because it is very likely to make people uncomfortable.\n*   **\"Fading to Black\":** Some groups prefer to \"fade to black\" when romance becomes sexually intimate.\n*   **Content Warnings:** Content warnings and explanations for the inclusion of sensitive content are important.\n"

Examples of Open-Source RPGs with NSFW Content:**\n\n*   **LifePlay:** A free, open-source, and moddable life simulation RPG with NSFW content. It is licensed under AGPL-3.0.\n*   **RyonaRPG:** An open-source erotic RPG using the RPG Maker 2000 engine. The term \"ryona\" refers to \"seeking the bizarre\" and masturbation.\n*   **itch.io:** A platform that hosts several NSFW games, some of which are tagged as open-source and created with RPG Maker. These include visual novels, simulations, and games with themes like erotic horror or male objectification.\n\n**2. Community Standards and Guidelines:**\n\n*   **General Prohibition:** Many RPG communities and platforms prohibit explicitly sexual content, intense violence, or content that promotes discrimination. Some set the threshold at a \"hard R or NC-17 movie\" level.\n*   **Nuance and Maturity:** Some GUMSHOE games have an 18+ rating for violence and sexual content, allowing for darker themes with appropriate content warnings.\n*   **Consent and Safety:** Discussions about consent, boundaries, and safety tools (like lines and veils) are crucial in RPGs, especially when dealing with mature or controversial themes. \"Consent in Gaming\" is a free PDF resource that offers strategies for ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for all players.\n*   **Community-Specific Rules:** Individual communities often have specific rules regarding NSFW content, with some requiring it to be kept in designated sections or faded to black.\n*   **Legality:** Online platforms are obligated to remove illegal content and protect children, sometimes requiring age verification for certain adult content.\n\n**3. Legal Considerations:**\n\n*   **Obscenity:** Community standards play a role in determining what is legally obscene, though definitions vary.\n*   **UK Law:** UK-based companies are required to remove illegal content and add restrictions to children's access to adult content due to the Online Safety Act and Digital Services Act.\n*   **Terms of Service:** Online platforms often have Terms of Service that users must agree to, which absolve the platform of liability for misuse of resources.\n\n**4. Challenges and Approaches:**\n\n*   **Balancing Creativity and Restrictions:** Some users find content policies too restrictive, even when creating non-sexual content.\n*   **Open-Source Models:** Using open-source models may offer more flexibility, but guardrails are still needed to prevent inappropriate content generation.\n*   **Tagging and Categorization:** Platforms use tagging systems to categorize and filter adult content, allowing users to control their experience.\n\n**5. Resources and Communities:**\n\n*   **itch.io:** A digital marketplace with a variety of NSFW games, including some that are open-source.\n*   **SillyTavern:** A web UI for roleplaying with local language models, offering customization options and character expressions.\n*   **r/NSFW_GMing:** A Reddit community dedicated to NSFW RPG systems.\n\nIt's important to note that the legality and acceptability of sexually explicit content in RPGs depend heavily on local laws, community standards, and individual preferences.\n"

          "output": "While mainstream tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) have generally avoided explicit sexual content, some games incorporate mechanics that focus on or include sexual encounters. These games often differ significantly from traditional combat or skill-based systems, with a greater emphasis on roleplaying, storytelling, and exploring character relationships.\n\n**Common Mechanics and Rulesets:**\n\n*   **Lines and Veils:** Many groups use \"Lines\" and \"Veils\" to negotiate explicit content, rather than relaying blow-by-blow accounts of sexual activity. Lines are hard boundaries that are not to be crossed, where a player may veto a subject completely. A Veil is more of a fade to black; the player acknowledges the activity, but nothing is described.\n*   **Consent-based mechanics and intimacy tools:** These ensure players can enjoy and participate fully.\n*   **Sex Moves:** Some games, like *Apocalypse World* and *Monsterhearts*, feature \"sex moves,\" which are mechanics that trigger when characters have sex. These moves reflect the effects of personal intimacy upon the characters. *Monsterhearts* bases its rules on *Apocalypse World*, but sets the action in a monster-filled high school. Each character type in *Apocalypse World* comes with a custom sex move that allows you to exploit other players or NPC vulnerabilities.\n*   **Relationship Stats:** Some games use relationship stats to track the strength of connections between characters. For example, *Apocalypse World* uses a stat called \"Hx\" to represent the relationship between characters. *Golden Sky Stories* tracks the strength of relationships to fuel stats and special powers.\n*   **Intimacy Moves:** *Urban Shadows*, another game based on *Apocalypse World*, features an Intimacy move that determines what happens when characters share a moment of intimacy, whether physical or not.\n*   **Dice Rolls and Skill Checks:** Some systems use dice rolls or contested checks to resolve romantic or sexual encounters. For example, a player might roll a Performance check to seduce an NPC.\n*   **Narrative Control and GM Discretion:** In many games, sexual encounters are handled narratively, with the Game Master (GM) describing the scene and the players roleplaying their characters' reactions. The level of detail and explicitness is often left to the discretion of the GM and the comfort levels of the players.\n*   **The X Card:** The X card can be held up to stop a potentially triggering situation.\n\n**Differences from Traditional Systems:**\n\n*   **Focus on Relationships:** Unlike combat-focused systems, these mechanics prioritize the development and exploration of relationships between characters.\n*   **Emphasis on Consent and Safety:** Games that deal with sexual themes often incorporate safety tools and techniques to ensure all players are comfortable and respected.\n*   **Narrative over Mechanics:** While some games have specific rules for sexual encounters, many rely on narrative descriptions and roleplaying to drive the story forward.\n*   **Emotional Impact:** These systems often focus on the emotional and psychological consequences of intimacy, rather than simply resolving a physical act.\n*   **Social Maneuvering:** Some games, like *Monsterhearts*, place a greater emphasis on social maneuvering and manipulation in the context of relationships and sexuality.\n\nSome games, such as *F.A.T.A.L.*, have been criticized for their handling of sexual violence and their normalization of non-consensual acts. However, more recent games strive to create a safe and inclusive environment for exploring these themes.\n"

The focus is on improving access to employment, providing necessary support, and fostering a more inclusive work environment.\n\n**Key Developments and Policies:**\n\n*   **Law for Full Employment:** The law of December 18, 2023, aims to improve access to employment for people with disabilities. Since January 1, 2024, orientation towards mainstream employment is considered a universal right, with France Travail and Cap emploi providing adapted support.\n*   **ESATs and Transition to Mainstream Employment:** While orientation towards Établissement et Service d'Aide par le Travail (ESAT) (supported work environment) remains an option, a pilot program in 11 France Travail agencies since November 2024 aims to ensure that individuals are considered for mainstream employment first. This program will be generalized by January 1, 2027. The law also supports the CDD Tremplin (fixed-term contract) and Entreprise Adaptée de Travail Temporaire (EATT) (adapted temporary work company).\n*   **Agefiph's Financial Aid:** The Agefiph (Association de Gestion du Fonds pour l'Insertion Professionnelle des Personnes Handicapées) provides financial assistance to private sector employers for hiring and supporting people with disabilities. This includes aid for adapting training situations.\n*   **Aides for Hiring:** Employers can receive financial aid for hiring people with disabilities. Outside of apprenticeship contracts, employers need to request this aid from Agefiph. An \"aide à l'accueil, à l'intégration et à l'évolution professionnelle\" (aid for welcoming, integrating and professional development), with a maximum amount of €3,150, is available for companies (excluding adapted companies) that recruit a disabled worker on a permanent contract (CDI) or a fixed-term contract (CDD) of 6 months or more. This aid supports the integration of newly recruited disabled employees and can be used to prepare for their arrival or during the 9 months after they take office.\n*   **France Travail Initiatives:** France Travail offers the POEI (Préparation Opérationnelle à l'Emploi Individuelle), a financial aid to employers to fund training for job seekers, including those with disabilities, to acquire the skills needed for a specific job.\n*   **Semaine Européenne pour l'Emploi des Personnes Handicapées (SEEPH):** The 29th European Week for the Employment of People with Disabilities will take place from November 17 to 23, 2025. The theme for 2025 is \"Disabilities and employment: equality for all!\". This week aims to bring together companies, policymakers, associations, and job seekers with disabilities.\n*   **Events and Forums:** Several events are scheduled throughout the year to promote employment for people with disabilities. These include the Forum régional Emploi Handicap in Clermont-Ferrand (March 26, 2025) and the online forums Talents Handicap (April 22-25, 2025 and October 21-24, 2025).\n*   **Focus on Mental Health:** In 2025, mental health has been declared a Grande cause nationale, emphasizing the need to address prejudices and improve working conditions for people with mental health conditions.\n\n**Key Players:**\n\n*   **Agefiph:** Provides financial aid and support for the professional integration of people with disabilities.\n*   **FIPHFP (Fonds pour l'Insertion des Personnes Handicapées dans la Fonction Publique):** Works to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector.\n*   **France Travail:** The national employment agency, plays a key role in guiding and supporting people with disabilities in their job search.\n*   **Cap emploi:** Specialized agencies that work with France Travail to provide tailored support to people with disabilities.\n\n**Statistics and Challenges:**\n\n*   While the number of people with disabilities in employment has increased over the past 20 years, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities remains higher than the national average. In 2023, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities was 12%, compared to 7% for the general population.\n*   As of 2023, over 3 million people in France have administrative recognition of their disability.\n*   There are still challenges in access to employment, skills development, career advancement, and prevention of job loss.\n\n**Financial Aids and Support:**\n\n*   Agefiph offers various financial aids and services to secure the professional paths of people with disabilities, primarily aiming to compensate for the disability in employment.\n*   Since January 1, 2025, full coverage of disability compensation (100% of the costs of workstation adaptation) is again possible under the aid for adapting work situations (AST).\n*   Aides are available for employers who hire disabled employees, including independent disabled workers.\n\n**Mutuelle for ESAT Workers:**\n\n*   Workers in ESATs are expected to benefit from a collective mutuelle (health insurance) financed half by their employers. However, the implementation of this measure is delayed due to the absence of implementing decrees.\n\n**Overall, France is actively working to improve the professional integration of people with disabilities through legislation, financial support, awareness campaigns, and collaborative efforts between various stakeholders.**\n"

      "ai_message": "The impact of the latest U.S. tariff strategies on Imeik Technology's stock price forecast for 2025 is complex, influenced by several factors including the overall U.S.-China trade relationship, specific tariffs on materials used by Imeik, the company's strategies to mitigate tariff effects, currency exchange rates, and analyst revisions of financial forecasts.\n\n**Current Tariff Landscape and Trade Relations:** The U.S. maintains a 30% tariff on all Chinese goods as of July 2025, while China levies a 10% tariff on U.S. products [aljazeera](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). Some sources indicate the U.S. is getting a total of 55% tariffs from China [china-briefing](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5). The U.S.-China relationship has largely shifted to a technology battleground [discoveryalert](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0). The technology industry is particularly vulnerable to tariffs due to its complex global supply chains [techtarget](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n\n**Impact on Materials and Components:** Tariffs on semiconductor cells, syringes, and needles from China are expected to rise to 50% in 2025 [casemed](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). Raw materials like titanium, plastics, and semiconductors face a 15% tariff when imported from China [cognitivemarketresearch](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4]. Medical consumables like syringes, bandages, and gloves face a 20% tariff [cognitivemarketresearch](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4]. Since Imeik Technology researches, develops, produces, and sells biomedical materials, including injection-type sodium hyaluronate and polydioxanone facial implants [marketscreener](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6), these tariffs could significantly increase their production costs.\n\n**Mitigation Strategies:** Companies are employing strategies such as diversifying their supply chains, domestic sourcing, and leveraging technology to navigate tariffs [thomsonreuters](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0). They are also forming internal task forces and using scenario planning tools to evaluate different tariff scenarios [simon-kucher](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [aimms](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n\n**Currency Exchange Rate Dynamics:** Tariffs can lead to a depreciation of the CNY against the USD [epowercorp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5) [nasdaq](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6). A weaker CNY makes Chinese exports cheaper for U.S. buyers, potentially offsetting some of the tariff impact [xtransfer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7) [ig](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8). The PBoC may intervene to stabilize the currency [ing](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-9). Imeik Technology's profitability is affected by both tariffs and exchange rates [xtransfer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7) [claconnect](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1).\n\n**Analyst Revisions and Financial Performance:** Analyst reports indicate downward revisions in revenue and EPS estimates for Imeik Technology for fiscal year 2025 [moomoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0) [moomoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-1) [marketscreener](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-2). The consensus revenue forecast has been revised to CN¥3.25 billion [moomoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-1), with EPS forecasts also adjusted downwards [moomoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0) [moomoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-1). Sales expectations for the current fiscal year have been downgraded [marketscreener](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-2).\n\n**Government Subsidies and Support:** Imeik Technology may be able to leverage Chinese government subsidies aimed at boosting domestic demand and supporting technology companies [idc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0) [techhq](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-1), as well as benefit from the general push towards technological self-reliance [idc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0). China's \"dual circulation\" strategy prioritizes domestic consumption and non-western international trade [idc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0). The $138 billion Innovation Fund aims to boost homegrown tech innovation [idc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0).\n\n**Overall Impact on Stock Price:** While Imeik Technology has strong financial performance and positive analyst ratings [smartkarma](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8), the negative impacts of U.S. tariffs on the Chinese technology sector, coupled with valuation concerns and sales downgrades, could create downward pressure on the stock price. One analysis from late June 2025 suggested the stock was expected to fall -3.63% over the next 3 months [stockinvest](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-11). The fluctuating trade relationship between the U.S. and China and the uncertainty surrounding future tariffs make it difficult to provide a definitive stock price forecast.",

Imeik Technology Specifics:**\n\n*   **Stock Price:** As of July 14, 2025, Imeik Technology Development's stock price is $24.53, with a market cap of $7.42B.\n*   **Financial Performance:** Imeik Technology Development has a trailing 12-month revenue of $400M and an EPS of $0.86. In Q1 2025, the company reported a net income of 443.7 million yuan and revenue of 663.5 million yuan.\n*   **Analyst Ratings:** Analyst ratings for Imeik Technology are generally positive, with 32 buy recommendations, 2 hold ratings, and no sell ratings.\n*   **Growth Prospects:** Imeik Technology is positioned for a bright future with strong ratings in growth, resilience, and momentum. Growth is estimated to reach 45% by 2027.\n*   **Working Capital:** Imeik Technology Development has a Working Capital of 4.7 B.\n*   **Valuation Concerns:** Imeik Technology Development trades with high earnings multiples: 25.02 times its 2025 earnings per share. The company's valuation appears relatively high in relation to its tangible assets and cash flows.\n*   **Sales Downgrades:** Sales expectations for Imeik Technology have been downgraded, suggesting less important sales volumes are expected for the current fiscal year.\n*   **Stock Performance Trends:** One analysis from late June 2025 suggested the stock was expected to fall -3.63% over the next 3 months.\n\n**IV. General Market Impact:**\n\n*   **Uncertainty and Volatility:** Tariffs and trade tensions have created uncertainty and volatility in the stock market.\n*   **Earnings Impact:** Tariffs could cut S&P 500 earnings per share by 2-3%.\n*   **Price Increases:** Tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices.\n*   **GDP Impact:** Tariffs are expected to negatively impact US real GDP growth.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe impact of US tariffs on Imeik Technology's stock price forecast for 2025 is complex and multifaceted. While the company has strong financial performance and positive analyst ratings, the negative impacts of US tariffs on the Chinese technology sector, coupled with valuation concerns and sales downgrades, could create downward pressure on the stock price. The fluctuating trade relationship between the US and China and the uncertainty surrounding future tariffs make it difficult to provide a definitive stock price forecast.\n"

Tariff Impact on Technology Companies**\n\n*   **Supply Chain Disruption:** Technology companies, especially those relying on manufacturing in China and Southeast Asia, face disruptions to their supply chains due to tariffs. This can particularly affect hardware and semiconductor stocks.\n*   **Increased Costs:** Tariffs can increase the cost of imported goods, potentially leading to reduced profit margins and higher prices for consumers, which could slow demand. Companies may have to decide whether to absorb these costs, raise prices, or re-engineer products using alternative materials or suppliers.\n*   **Stock Price Volatility:** The uncertainty surrounding tariffs and their effect on the global economy can lead to stock market volatility. Tech-heavy indices can experience significant drops.\n*   **Relocation of Manufacturing:** Tariffs can incentivize companies to relocate production from overseas to domestic facilities, involving significant investments.\n\n**2. Currency Exchange Rate Dynamics**\n\n*   **CNY Depreciation:** Tariffs can lead to a depreciation of the CNY against the USD. A weaker CNY makes Chinese exports cheaper for US buyers, potentially offsetting some of the tariff impact.\n*   **PBoC Intervention:** The People's Bank of China (PBoC) may intervene to stabilize the currency. They can adjust the USD/CNY reference rate to influence the exchange rate.\n*   **Hedging Strategies:** Businesses operating internationally should revisit their foreign exchange hedging programs to minimize tariff-linked losses due to currency shifts.\n\n**3. Impact on Imeik Technology**\n\n*   **Profitability:** Imeik Technology's profitability is affected by both tariffs and exchange rates. Tariffs increase costs, while a weaker CNY could offset some of these costs by making their products more competitive in the US market.\n*   **Stock Performance:** Imeik Technology Development Co's stock is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Events such as tariff announcements and trade war escalations can lead to market uncertainty and fluctuations in the stock market, which affects Imeik's stock price.\n*   **Q1 2025 Results:** Imeik Technology faced temporary pressure with a year-on-year decline in revenue and net income in Q1 2025, partly attributed to a high base in the previous year.\n\n**4. Countermeasures and Mitigation Strategies**\n\n*   **Supply Chain Diversification:** Companies can mitigate tariff risks by diversifying their supply chains.\n*   **Free Trade Zones (FTZs):** Utilizing FTZs can delay or reduce tariff exposure.\n*   **Negotiating with Manufacturers:** Companies can negotiate with their China-based manufacturers to absorb costs.\n*   **Pricing Strategies:** Companies may need to reassess their pricing models and communicate transparently with customers about tariff-related price adjustments.\n\n**5. Specific Tariff Rates and Trade War Developments**\n\n*   **Escalating Tariffs:** The US has imposed increasingly higher tariffs on Chinese goods, reaching levels as high as 104% on all Chinese imports.\n*   **China's Retaliation:** China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods.\n*   **Reciprocal Tariffs:** The Trump administration is considering applying tariffs against a broader range of foreign taxes, which could significantly impact trade.\n\n**6. Examples of Impact on Other Tech Companies**\n\n*   **Apple:** Apple is vulnerable due to its extensive manufacturing operations in China, but could mitigate the impact by shifting production outside of China.\n*   **Nvidia:** Tariffs affect Nvidia's cost structure, potentially impacting the price and availability of its products. Nvidia announced plans to invest in manufacturing AI chips in the U.S..\n\n**7. Market Reactions and Investor Sentiment**\n\n*   **Hang Seng Index:** Chinese financial markets have responded negatively to the escalation of trade tensions, with the Hang Seng Index entering bear market territory.\n*   **Investor Concerns:** Market volatility reflects growing investor concern about China's economic outlook.\n*   **Safe-Haven Investments:** Investors may turn to gold as a safe-haven investment during times of tariff-related uncertainty.\n\n**In summary,** currency exchange rates and US tariffs create a complex environment for Imeik Technology. While a weaker CNY can provide some relief by making exports more competitive, tariffs increase costs and create uncertainty. Companies can employ various strategies, such as supply chain diversification and currency hedging, to mitigate these risks. The ultimate impact on Imeik Technology's profitability and stock price depends on the magnitude of the tariffs, the extent of CNY depreciation, and the effectiveness of the company's mitigation strategies.\n"

          "output": "Based on the search results, here's information regarding unique items recommended for a high-end Lich build in Path of Exile 2, besides Atziri's Disdain:\n\n**Core Skills & Ascendancy**\n\n*   The Lich build in Path of Exile 2 is a specialized summoner setup that utilizes the Lich ascendancy to maximize the effectiveness of minions.\n*   Skills like Skeletal Sniper, Skeletal Arsonist, Skeletal Cleric, Shield Charge, Pain Offering, Despair, Contagion, Essence Drain, Convalescence, and Dark Effigy are good choices for a Lich build.\n*   The Witch class offers the best passive skills that increase your survivability, especially during the early stages.\n*   Lich is a strong ascendancy choice, offering offensive strategies and the ability to curse more enemies. It allows you to deal high Chaos damage and explode enemies, dealing 25% of their maximum Life as Chaos damage.\n\n**Recommended Unique Items**\n\n*   **Withered Wand:** This is a good main-hand weapon, dealing increased spell damage and chaos damage. Look for wands with +1 to level of all Chaos Spell Skills, +1 to all Spell Skills, cast speed, and increased Chaos or Spell Damage.\n*   **Chiming Staff:** For the second weapon set, a Chiming Staff with a high-level Sigil of Power is recommended. Alternatively, a Sire of Shards with a level 19 Sigil of Power can be a cheap option.\n*   **The Sacrosanctum:** This unique body armor is a viable option, especially for Skeletal Storm Mage Lich builds, due to its ability to recoup life and energy shield when you receive damage.\n*   **Kamasan Tiara:** This is a preferred helmet with \"+2 to Level of All Minion Skills\". Prefixes should focus on ES mods and increased maximum life.\n*   **Vaal Gloves:** These gloves offer the highest amount of energy shield. Look for energy shield, mana, and dexterity.\n*   **Nascent Hope (Charm):** This charm has great synergy with Withered effects.\n*   **Rings:** Rings with cast speed are beneficial.\n*   **The Pandemonius (Jade Amulet):** A powerful amulet tailored for cold damage builds. It provides 75% Cold Resistance penetration and causes your hits to Blind and Chill enemies.\n*   **Thief's Torment (Unique ring):** Great for builds that prioritize life steal. It gives you life and mana back when you hit enemies, as well as increased rarity.\n\n**General Gear Recommendations**\n\n*   Prioritize gear with resistances and energy shield.\n*   Look for gear that complements your playstyle and synergizes well with the build.\n*   Dexterity, Strength, and Intelligence are the best regular attributes to focus on because they enhance your effectiveness and boost the spell damage and accuracy.\n*   Increased Spirit, + to Mana, + to Level of All Minion Skills, Allies in Your Presence Deal % Increased Damage, + to Maximum Energy Shield, and Increased Energy Shield are ideal modifiers to look for on your gear.\n*   You want as much energy shield as possible on your body armour, boots, helmet, gloves and amulet to make yourself tankier.\n\n**Enhancements to Build Performance**\n\n*   **Essence Drain & Contagion:** These skills are a core part of the Lich build, with Essence Drain dealing damage and Contagion spreading it between packs of enemies.\n*   **Dark Effigy:** This skill improves single-target damage.\n*   **Despair:** This curse lowers enemy Chaos Resistance, increasing single-target damage.\n*   **Withered:** Skills and gear that inflict Withered on enemies are valuable, as it increases the Chaos damage they take. Aim for at least 40% increased effect of Withered across all jewels.\n*   **Sigil of Power:** This skill provides a big boost of damage for bosses.\n*   **Energy Shield:** Focus on maximizing energy shield to improve survivability.\n*   **Mana Regeneration:** Sufficient mana regeneration is necessary to cast abilities.\n*   **Cast Speed:** Increased cast speed improves the overall quality of life of the build.\n\n**Crafting Recommendations**\n\n*   For crafting a chaos wand, use specific wand bases like Attuned Wand, Siphoning Wand, or Wizard Wand.\n*   Use Essence of Ruin + Chaos Spells or Chaos Damage.\n*   Aim for item level 81+ for the wand to roll +5 spells.\n\n**Leveling**\n\n*   In the early game, focus on both Minion Health and Chaos Damage in the passive skill tree.\n*   Intelligence will be your primary stat focus, but you will need a few points in Dexterity to attach certain Support Gems.\n*   Once you reach the endgame, completely focus on Chaos Damage.\n"

In the past year alone, 130 more newspapers folded, resulting in the loss of over 7,000 newsroom jobs.\n*   **Limited Replacement:** Alternative local news sources, such as digital and ethnic news outlets, and public broadcasting, have not kept pace with the loss of traditional newspapers.\n*   **Geographic Distribution:** News deserts are prevalent in both rural and urban areas. In Washington state, over half of the counties fall below the average number of news outlets per capita, with some counties lacking any qualifying news source.\n*   **European Context:** The concept of news deserts is also relevant in Europe, where they have the potential to undermine civic engagement and democracy.\n\n**Impact on Civic Engagement:**\n\n*   **Diminished Participation:** The proliferation of news deserts is linked to diminished civic engagement, including lower voter turnout, fewer contested races, and poorer public participation.\n*   **Erosion of Social Capital:** A lack of local news negatively affects community social capital, including economic connectedness, cohesiveness, and civic engagement.\n*   **Increased Misinformation:** News deserts are often flooded with misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information, making true civic engagement difficult. Social media has emerged as a primary source of news in these areas, exacerbating the problem.\n*   **Weakened Government Accountability:** The decline of local journalism leads to weakened government accountability. Research indicates that political corruption increases when local papers close.\n*   **Decline in Civic Trust:** Community newspaper closures have been linked to diminished civic trust and political participation.\n\n**Factors Contributing to News Deserts:**\n\n*   **Economic Challenges:** Local news outlets face financial challenges, including an over-reliance on advertising-based revenue models. Many operate on minimal budgets, making it difficult to retain staff.\n*   **Digital Transformation:** The digital transformation and the 2008 global economic crisis have contributed to the crisis of traditional news media and the vanishing of local news outlets.\n*   **Market Conditions:** Population and education levels have strong negative associations with news deserts.\n\n**Potential Solutions and Responses:**\n\n*   **Embracing Technology:** Local news outlets need to adopt new technologies, including AI, to improve newsroom productivity and produce high-quality journalism.\n*   **Community Support:** Outlets are showing innovation, sustained by grants, community support, and collaborative reporting strategies.\n*   **Alternative Funding Models:** Non-profit and foundation/university/grant-financed sites incorporate more interactive features than advertising-supported sites.\n*   **Philanthropic Funding:** Increasing venture and philanthropic funding toward news organizations that seek to deliver reliable and comprehensive local news and information to residents in news deserts is crucial.\n*   **Policy and Incentives:** Designing policies and incentives at the state and national levels to address the disparity and availability of news in these communities is needed.\n*   **Strengthening Local News Ecosystems:** Building networks of trust among communities and sustaining vibrant information ecosystems are essential for healthy democracies.\n*   **Promoting Civic Journalism:** Civic journalism organizations have emerged to fill the void in some areas, covering civic affairs and encouraging civic engagement.\n\n**Glimmers of Hope:**\n\n*   **Pockets of Growth:** Despite the overall trend, some counties have added newspapers or experienced net growth driven by digital sites.\n*   **Statewide Startups:** Smaller states have seen the emergence of startups and the growth of existing alternatives.\n*   **Investment in Local Journalism:** Some organizations are investing in local journalism to strengthen local relationships and partnerships.\n\nFurther analyses of a possible correlation between news deserts and abstentions in local elections should be carried out, drawing on data from recent elections.\n"

Citizens may rely on word-of-mouth and social media for information, which can spread misinformation.\n*   A lack of local reporting can make local government less transparent and responsive.\n\n**Strategies to Combat News Deserts:**\n\n*   **Support for Local News Organizations:**\n    *   Entrepreneurial and civic-minded outlets are re-energizing the local news business.\n    *   Local nonprofit news organizations are changing how local news is sustained, benefiting from the recognition of local news as a public good.\n    *   Policies should help local news organizations develop sustainable models, especially those that are locally-grounded, diverse, or nonprofit.\n*   **Funding and Financial Assistance:**\n    *   Government subsidies, such as a super-sized Newsmatch fund, can provide matching funds for local nonprofit news organizations.\n    *   The Local Journalism Sustainability Act proposes a refundable tax credit for taxpayers to subscribe to local news sources or donate to local nonprofit news organizations.\n    *   The Community Reinvestment Act can be used to provide financial assistance to struggling small, independent for-profit and nonprofit news organizations.\n    *   The Local Media Association (LMA) Lab for Journalism Funding helps news organizations raise philanthropic support.\n    *   The Local News Initiative of Southern Arizona provides grants to strengthen local journalism.\n    *   The EU is funding projects to revive local media landscapes, build resilience, and improve sustainability.\n*   **Innovative Business Models and Revenue Streams:**\n    *   Encourage young journalists and retain experienced ones by rethinking pay, newsroom culture, and opportunities for innovation.\n    *   Pursue new revenue models to replace diminishing traditional revenue sources.\n    *   Develop digital revenue strategies that align with the marketing needs of local businesses, such as search engine optimization, social media management, website design, and video production.\n    *   Diversify revenue sources, moving away from print advertising.\n*   **Collaboration and Partnerships:**\n    *   Increase collaboration among journalists and news organizations to cover stories in resource-strapped environments.\n    *   Encourage partnerships between for-profit news organizations and nonprofits, or between universities and nonprofits.\n    *   The BBC could transform from a competitor to a strategic partner in local media ecosystem regeneration by focusing on resource sharing and supporting independent local journalism.\n*   **Embracing New Technology:**\n    *   Embrace new technology more quickly, including digital journalism.\n    *   Adopt a tech-forward attitude and use tools like AI to increase newsroom productivity and capacity for producing high-quality journalism.\n    *   AI can help newsrooms scale their digital presence, generate audio and video versions of content, and summarize information.\n*   **Community Engagement:**\n    *   Increase opportunities for journalists to meet, greet, and listen to residents.\n    *   Develop journalism responses to community needs that go beyond reporting on the problem and engage the community.\n    *   Meet people in the spaces and places where they get their information.\n*   **Supporting Journalists:**\n    *   Support journalists who pursue careers in local public service journalism.\n    *   Put more reporters into local newsrooms through national service programs.\n    *   Offer loan forgiveness for journalists who work at local nonprofit news organizations or Public Benefit Corporations.\n*   **Policy and Advocacy:**\n    *   Press associations need to work with news organizations to support research and development of business models and revenue strategies.\n    *   Rebuild Local News is urging the Federal Reserve to utilize the Community Reinvestment Act to provide financial assistance to struggling news organizations.\n    *   Implement policies that are content-neutral, nonpartisan, and ensure editorial independence.\n*   **Refocus on Local:**\n    *   Ensure government advertising spending on local media includes sponsorships or underwriting for nonprofit news organizations.\n*   **Address Distrust:**\n    *   Part of the mission might be to remind potential readers what journalists do to improve their communities and to battle distrust of the news media.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n*   The geography of the country and population distribution complicate matters, as more than 95% of the land mass in the U.S. is rural, yet only 20% of the population lives outside major urban areas.\n*   Many tactics, such as increasing subscriber revenue, are of limited value in smaller markets, where most outlets remain dependent on advertising or major grants and donations.\n*   The loss of federal funding for public media could impact local stations.\n*   It is important to address the multi-faceted challenges that local newsrooms face, including tenuous fiscal situations and limited resources.\n\n**Overall, a multi-pronged approach is needed to combat news deserts, including financial support, innovative business models, collaboration, community engagement, and policy changes.**\n"

These plant-derived metabolites influence microbial communities through various mechanisms, including direct antimicrobial activity, iron mobilization, and modulation of plant defense responses.\n\n**Specific Effects of Coumarins:**\n\n*   **Scopoletin:** This coumarin exhibits antimicrobial activity and impacts the assembly of the root-associated microbiome. It selectively inhibits the growth of soil-borne fungal pathogens like *Fusarium oxysporum* and *Verticillium dahliae*, while having little to no effect on beneficial rhizobacteria that induce systemic resistance (ISR). *Pseudomonas simiae* WCS417, a beneficial bacterium, can stimulate scopoletin production by roots, further influencing the soil microbiome and improving plant health. Scopoletin can be converted into esculetin by certain fungi, which helps in iron chelation.\n*   **Fraxetin:** Fraxetin is another coumarin secreted by *Arabidopsis* roots under iron deficiency, especially at elevated pH. It is synthesized from scopoletin via scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H). Fraxetin can mobilize iron and facilitate its uptake by the plant. It can form stable complexes with Fe(III) at neutral to alkaline pH, which can be directly taken up by the plant, circumventing the FRO2/IRT1 system.\n\n**Coumarins and Root Microbiome Composition:**\n\n*   **Shaping the Rhizobiome:** Coumarins, in general, contribute to structuring the rhizobiome. A lack of coumarin biosynthesis in *f6′h1* mutant plant lines leads to a shift in the root microbial community, specifically under iron deficiency. Coumarins limit the growth of certain *Pseudomonas* species via a redox-mediated mechanism.\n*   **Iron Mobilization:** Coumarins like esculetin, fraxetin, and sideretin are involved in mobilizing iron under iron-limiting stress conditions. The ATP-binding cassette transporter PDR9 is required for the selective exudation of catecholic coumarins (esculetin, fraxetin, and sideretin) under iron deficiency.\n*   **pH Dependence:** The coumarin profile of iron-deficient *Arabidopsis* plants depends on the pH of the growth substrate. At lower pH, scopoletin and sideretin are more abundant in root exudates, while fraxetin becomes more prevalent at alkaline pH levels.\n\n**Mechanisms of Action:**\n\n*   **Antimicrobial Activity:** Scopoletin possesses antimicrobial properties, influencing the microbial community composition in the rhizosphere. It can deter fungal hyphae, while certain beneficial rhizobacteria exhibit tolerance to scopoletin.\n*   **Redox-Mediated Inhibition:** Coumarins can inhibit the proliferation of certain bacteria, such as *Pseudomonas* species, through a redox-mediated mechanism.\n*   **Iron Nutrition:** Coumarins improve plant performance by facilitating microbe-assisted iron nutrition. The bacterial root microbiota, stimulated by secreted coumarins, becomes an integral mediator of plant adaptation to iron-limiting soils.\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n*   **MYB72 Regulation:** The root-specific transcription factor MYB72 regulates the excretion of scopoletin, influencing the assembly of the root-associated microbial community.\n*   **\"Cry-for-Help\" Hypothesis:** Plants may modify root chemistry upon stress, such as exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), to accommodate degrading bacteria. This involves remodeling the nutritional and signaling features of the root niche.\n*   **Beneficial Microbe Interactions:** Coumarins can promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms and enhance plant defense mechanisms. For instance, scopoletin stimulates the growth of *Pseudomonas simiae* WCS417, which enhances plant defense via induced systemic resistance (ISR).\n\nIn summary, coumarins like scopoletin and fraxetin have multifaceted roles in shaping the *Arabidopsis* root microbiome by directly affecting microbial growth, mobilizing iron, and mediating plant-microbe interactions, particularly under iron-deficient conditions.\n"

          "output": "Coumarins, including scopoletin and fraxetin, are key metabolites derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, playing critical roles in plant development, interactions with the environment, and responses to stress. These coumarins are particularly important for iron acquisition and plant defense.\n\n**Biosynthesis and Initial Metabolism**\n\nThe general phenylpropanoid pathway produces feruloyl-CoA, which is metabolized by feruloyl-CoA 6'-hydroxylase 1 (F6'H1) and coumarin synthase (COSY) to produce scopoletin. F6'H1 catalyzes the O-hydroxylation of feruloyl CoA, followed by spontaneous isomerization and lactonization to form scopoletin. COSY catalyzes the enzymatic step from 6-hydroxyferuloyl-CoA into scopoletin, although this conversion can also occur spontaneously, aided by light. Scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H) then catalyzes the conversion of scopoletin to fraxetin.\n\n**Downstream Metabolic Pathways and Compounds**\n\n1.  **Fraxetin and Sideretin:** Scopoletin is converted into fraxetin via hydroxylation by scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H). Fraxetin can be further oxidized by the CYP enzyme CYP82C4 to produce sideretin. Sideretin is a dominant chemical reductant in *Arabidopsis* that, along with FERRIC REDUCTION OXIDASE2 (FRO2), contributes to generating Fe(II) for root uptake under acidic conditions. At alkaline pH, the transcription factor MYB72 shifts coumarin biosynthesis away from sideretin and toward fraxetin. Under these conditions, fraxetin provides soluble Fe(III) substrates for FRO2.\n2.  **Esculetin:** A fungal endophyte, *Macrophomina phaseolina* (F80), can modify scopoletin into the iron-chelating catechol coumarin esculetin, which releases available iron.\n3.  **Scopolin:** Scopoletin can be converted to scopolin via the activity of glycosyltransferases and converted back to scopoletin by β-glucosidases.\n\n**Functions and Regulation**\n\n*   **Iron Acquisition:** Coumarins, including scopoletin, fraxetin, and sideretin, play a role in iron acquisition. Under iron-deficient conditions, *Arabidopsis* roots secrete coumarins to help mobilize and acquire iron. The ATP-binding cassette transporter PDR9 is required for the selective exudation of catecholic coumarins (esculetin, fraxetin, and sideretin) under iron deficiency in *Arabidopsis* roots.\n*   **Antimicrobial Activity and Plant Defense:** Coumarins and their derivatives are involved in plant defense reactions against various pathogens. Scopoletin can inhibit soil-borne fungal pathogens. In infected *Arabidopsis*, MYB15 regulates F6'H1 activity and the subsequent accumulation of lignin and scopoletin.\n*   **Regulation by Environmental Factors:** The biosynthesis and accumulation of coumarins are regulated by abiotic factors such as nutrient availability, water status, temperature, and light conditions, as well as biotic stressors like pathogenic microorganisms and herbivorous pests.\n*   **Role in Plant-Microbe Interactions:** *Arabidopsis*-produced scopoletin functions as a precursor for fungal conversion into iron-chelating coumarins. Coumarins are central to commensal-mediated enhancement of plant iron nutrition across microbial kingdoms.\n*   **Hormonal Effects:** Coumarin promotes the elongation of the hypocotyl by increasing the synthesis of brassinosteroids (BR) in plants.\n*   **Phytoalexin Synthesis:** ANAC042 regulates the synthesis of scopoletin, camalexin, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-carbonyl nitrile (4OH-ICN).\n*   **Other coumarins:** Umbelliferone serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of other coumarins and as an entry point for furanocoumarins biosynthesis.\n"

          "output": "The PIX (Private Internet eXchange) Firewall, a pioneering network security device offering firewall and network address translation (NAT) capabilities, was invented in 1994 by Network Translation Inc., a company founded by John Mayes. Brantley Coile, working as a consultant software developer, designed and coded the PIX Firewall. Johnson Wu also participated in the design and testing.\n\nThe PIX firewall was created to address the IPv4 address depletion problem by securely connecting private networks to the internet using a limited number of registered IP addresses. The PIX name was derived from the aim of creating the functional equivalent of an IP PBX to solve the registered IP address shortage. The PIX was designed to conceal blocks of IP addresses behind a single or multiple registered IP addresses, similar to how PBXs work for internal phone extensions.\n\nThe PIX firewall quickly gained recognition, receiving the \"Hot Product of the Year\" award from Data Communications Magazine in January 1995. Cisco Systems acquired Network Translation Inc. in November 1995 to expand into the network security market and gain the rights to the PIX technology. The PIX became a flagship firewall product for Cisco.\n\nIn 2005, Cisco introduced the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) platform to succeed the PIX. In 2008, Cisco announced the end-of-sale for the PIX. The PIX technology was also available as a blade, the FireWall Services Module (FWSM), for the Cisco Catalyst 6500 switch series and the 7600 Router series, but it reached end-of-support status in September 2007.\n\nThe first PIX firewall was deployed in November 1994 as a beta test. The first customer acceptance occurred on December 21, 1994, at KLA Instruments in San Jose, California.\n\nThe PIX firewall was a stateful inspection firewall. It included features such as Access Control Lists (ACLs), NAT/PAT, and protocol-specific filtering. The PIX OS was a layer 4 firewall with stateful inspection of return traffic. The PIX was the first commercially available firewall product to introduce protocol-specific filtering using the \"fixup\" command.\n\n"

ChaCha is also optimized for mobile devices and has a higher CPU efficiency.\n*   **Hash Algorithms:** SHA-3 and SHA-2 are commonly employed hash functions for randomization in cryptography. SHA-3 is more secure but its slower software implementation prevents it from being widely utilized.\n*   **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA):** DSA is used to generate digital signatures, often in conjunction with the SHA-2 family of hash functions.\n*   **One-Time Pad (OTP):** Symmetric security mechanisms, such as OTP, are frequently employed to safeguard transmissions.\n*   **HIGHT:** HIGHT lightweight encryption algorithm can be used to cipher payload data to increase security MAVLink communication protocol.\n\n**Key Management Protocols:**\n\n*   **Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange:** DH key exchange algorithm can be combined with Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) within ROS communication channels to authenticate exchanged UAV data.\n*   **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** PKI, along with Elliptic Curve Cryptography, can be used for inter-drone communication authentication, though it can be resource-intensive.\n*   **Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs):** PUFs can be integrated with low-complexity cryptographic primitives for secure mutual authentication, without storing secret information on the UAV. PUFs can also be merged with quantum-resistant key-exchange methods to future-proof UAV networks.\n*   **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and Hash Function:** These are used to construct a swarm key by combining the local key and the session key to reduce the overhead of individual UAV nodes in the swarm.\n*   **Swarm Broadcast Protocol (SBP):** SBP contains a security key management scheme that manages a broadcast key among the swarm for a leader to broadcast encrypted messages to followers.\n\n**Strengths and Weaknesses Against Modern Cryptanalysis Techniques:**\n\n*   **ECC:** Offers a high level of security and resilience to various cryptographic attacks due to the mathematical properties of elliptic curves.\n*   **Lightweight Algorithms:** Designed to be efficient on resource-constrained devices, but their security needs to be carefully evaluated against modern cryptanalysis techniques. Comparative analysis assesses performance metrics such as encryption and decryption speeds, resource utilization, and resistance to cryptographic vulnerabilities against established algorithms like AES.\n*   **Vulnerabilities:** UAVs are susceptible to various security attacks such as data modification, denial of service, snooping, man-in-the-middle, and WiFi attacks. Communication links are vulnerable to jamming, GPS spoofing, and cyber warfare.\n*   **Countermeasures:** Common protective measures include encrypting command, control, and data links, deploying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), implementing strict authentication systems, and enhancing data integrity and traceability through quantum cryptography and blockchain technology.\n\n**Specific to Kamikaze Drones:**\n\n*   **Data Link Security:** Kamikaze drones rely on encrypted data links for human control, which creates vulnerabilities if these links are attacked physically, jammed electronically, or subverted through cyber warfare.\n*   **Autonomy:** The vulnerability of communication links to interference is an argument for greater autonomy in kamikaze drones.\n*   **Spoofing:** Neural networks used in machine learning for autonomous weapons are intrinsically vulnerable to spoofing.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   **Military Drone Requirements:** Military drones require stringent communication and data link protection due to risks like information theft, malicious tampering, false commands, and GPS position spoofing.\n*   **UAS Communication Disruptors:** Disrupting drone communications has become a frontline defense strategy, using AI-powered drone mitigation systems and real-time drone communication interference tools.\n*   **Cybersecurity Threats:** UAVs are increasingly susceptible to cybersecurity threats, including interception, spoofing, and hijacking.\n\nIt's important to note that the field of UAV security is constantly evolving, and new vulnerabilities and countermeasures are being developed all the time.\n"

They are a specialized form of GNSS antenna designed to mitigate interference from electronic jamming by using multiple antenna elements combined with digital signal processing to dynamically adjust the gain pattern and null out the interference. Unlike Fixed Reception Pattern Antennas (FRPAs), CRPAs can modify their reception pattern in real-time, effectively reducing the impact of jamming signals.\n\n**Key Characteristics of CRPAs:**\n\n*   **Multiple Antenna Elements:** CRPAs consist of several separate antenna elements arranged in a specific pattern. The number of elements affects the number of simultaneous attacks that can be neutralized.\n*   **Adaptive Signal Processing:** CRPAs employ sophisticated signal processing techniques, including beamforming, null steering, and spatial filtering.\n    *   **Beamforming:** Combines signals from multiple elements to create a directional reception pattern that enhances the gain toward legitimate GPS satellites.\n    *   **Null Steering:** Identifies the direction of interfering signals and creates \"nulls\" in the reception pattern to minimize their impact.\n    *   **Spatial Filtering:** Exploits the spatial separation between desired and undesired signals to differentiate between legitimate satellite signals and malicious transmissions.\n*   **Dynamic Reception Pattern:** CRPAs can dynamically adjust their reception pattern in real-time to ensure gain in the direction of genuine GNSS satellite signals and nulls in the direction of unwanted signals. The antenna's reception pattern is highly adaptable and can be changed rapidly to protect against attacks from varying directions.\n*   **Anti-Jamming and Anti-Spoofing:** CRPAs are designed to resist radio jamming and spoofing. They minimize jamming signals using null generation or null steering and maximize \"truth\" signals using beamforming or beam steering.\n*   **Versatility:** CRPAs can be used in various applications, from military and defense to commercial and consumer use. They are also compatible with different GPS/GNSS bands.\n\n**Effectiveness Against Ukrainian Electronic Warfare Tactics:**\n\n*   **Mitigation of Jamming and Spoofing:** CRPAs are highly efficient in countering jamming and spoofing by dynamically adjusting to mitigate such disruptive signals.\n*   **Resilience to Signal Interference:** CRPAs enhance the resilience of GNSS signals by providing anti-jamming capabilities, ensuring uninterrupted and accurate data even in challenging environments where signal interference is prevalent.\n*   **Protection Against Multiple Types of RF Interference:** CRPAs are designed to protect GNSS receivers against multiple types of RF interference, including intentional GNSS frequency jamming and spoofing attacks.\n*   **Enhanced Navigation and Timing:** CRPAs allow military ground vehicles to maintain accurate navigation and timing information in GPS-denied environments, ensuring that vehicles can continue to operate effectively during electronic warfare engagements.\n*   **Improved Accuracy and Reliability:** With their advanced design and signal processing techniques, CRPAs offer improved accuracy and reliability in a variety of applications.\n\n**Developments and Upgrades:**\n\n*   **Increased Number of Antenna Elements:** Russia has been increasing the number of antenna elements in its CRPAs, from 4 to 8 to 12 and beyond, to improve their ability to overcome jammers. In March 2025, Ukraine discovered the first Russian Shaheds that utilize a CRPA with 16 elements, instead of the usual 8 or 12.\n*   **Integration of Chinese CRPA Antennas:** Ukrainian experts discovered a 16-element CRPA antenna from China in a Russian Shahed.\n*   **Kometa-M24 Upgrade:** Russia has introduced a new electronic warfare-resistant guidance system, the Kometa-M24, which integrates a 24-element CRPA array.\n*   **Mobile Communication Modules:** Russia has begun equipping newly produced Shahed-136 strike drones with mobile communication and data transmission systems.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   **Form Factor and Power Consumption:** CRPAs can have a large form factor, which can be prohibitive for smaller devices and devices where weight is a key consideration. They also consume more power than FRPAs.\n*   **Not 100% Protection:** CRPAs cannot always be relied upon to provide 100% protection and should be used as one element in a layered approach to PNT hardening.\n*   **Requires Additional Antenna Element to Generate Each Null:** The limitation is that it requires an additional antenna element to generate each null.\n\n**Countermeasures:**\n\n*   **Electronic Warfare Systems:** Ukraine has deployed vast numbers of electronic jamming and spoofing devices to make Russian weapons miss their targets.\n*   **Spatially Separated EW Stations:** Ukrainian forces would need at least 16 spatially separated EW stations acting in coordination to simulate false satellite signals to effectively disrupt systems using 16-element CRPAs.\n*   **\"Lima\" Electronic Warfare System:** Ukraine has developed a new electronic warfare system called \"Lima,\" capable of disrupting the satellite navigation of Russian glide bombs equipped with the UMPK guidance kit.\n\nIn conclusion, CRPAs with up to 16 elements offer significant advantages in countering electronic warfare tactics through adaptive signal processing and dynamic reception pattern adjustment. The effectiveness of CRPAs is directly related to the number of antenna elements, with more elements enabling the neutralization of more simultaneous attacks. However, the ongoing electronic warfare between Russia and Ukraine involves continuous upgrades and countermeasures, making it a dynamic and evolving landscape.\n"

          "output": "Fiber optic control systems for kamikaze drones offer a compelling alternative to traditional radio frequency (RF) control, particularly in environments with heavy electronic warfare (EW) activity. However, deploying these systems in real-world battlefield scenarios presents several practical limitations and challenges.\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n\n*   **Immunity to Jamming:** Fiber optic links are impervious to RF jamming, a significant advantage in modern EW environments. Unlike radio uplinks, the hardwired connection is not susceptible to noise or targeted jammers.\n*   **Enhanced Security:** Fiber optic cables do not radiate signals that can be intercepted, providing a more secure communication channel.\n*   **Improved Video Quality:** Fiber optic cables offer high bandwidth, enabling real-time HD video transmission from the drone to the operator.\n*   **Low Altitude Operation:** Fiber optic drones can operate at lower altitudes compared to wireless drones, making them harder to detect.\n\n**Limitations and Challenges:**\n\n*   **Vulnerability of the Fiber Optic Cable:** The cable itself is a potential \"Achilles' heel\". It can snag or sever on obstacles like ruins, trees, and power lines, especially in urban battlefields. If the fiber is cut or yanked, the drone loses communication immediately.\n*   **Limited Maneuverability and Speed:** The tethered nature of fiber optic drones imposes performance constraints. The cable drag restricts sharp turns and rapid acceleration, making them less agile than wireless drones.\n*   **Range Constraints:** Fiber drones are restricted to relatively short-range operations. The maximum range is limited by the cable length, typically 5-15 km. While a reported 50-kilometer cable exists, its feasibility is questionable due to weight, durability, and deployment challenges.\n*   **Logistical Footprint:** The need for spools adds complexity to logistics and deployment. Managing and deploying long cables across varied terrain increases the risk of entanglement or breakage.\n*   **Cost:** Implementing fiber optic communication systems requires significant upfront investment. Specialized fiber optic cables have higher manufacturing costs due to design and testing requirements. The cost of the fiber optic cable can be significant. For example, Ukraine was limited to 500 units due to the cable costing $500, while the drone only cost $400.\n*   **Deployment Speed:** The deployment of fiber optic cables can be slower and more complex compared to wireless systems.\n*   **Specialized Expertise:** Installation and maintenance of fiber optic systems require specialized expertise, increasing costs. There is a limited availability of skilled workforce for designing, installing, and maintaining specialized fiber optic systems.\n\n**Mitigation Strategies and Future Trends:**\n\n*   **Advanced Materials and Manufacturing:** Continued investment in advanced materials and manufacturing techniques is crucial to improve cable durability and reliability.\n*   **Miniaturization:** The trend toward smaller and lighter equipment demands miniaturized fiber optic cables with high performance.\n*   **Self-Healing Cables:** Development of self-healing fiber optic cables can enhance reliability in harsh environments.\n*   **AI Integration:** Combining fiber optic reliability with artificial intelligence can reduce the need for human operators and enhance autonomous capabilities.\n*   **Robotics:** Fiber-optic controlled unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) can deliver supplies to front-line troops, reducing the risk to human drivers.\n\n**Market Trends:**\n\n*   The military fiber optic cable market is experiencing robust growth, driven by the increasing demand for high-bandwidth, secure communication systems.\n*   The market is projected to reach approximately $4.2 billion by 2033, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7% from 2025.\n*   Key players are investing in R&D to enhance product performance and expand their market share.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nFiber optic control systems offer significant advantages for kamikaze drones, particularly in EW-heavy environments. However, practical limitations related to cable vulnerability, range, maneuverability, logistics, and cost must be addressed. Ongoing technological advancements and innovative deployment strategies are crucial to maximizing the effectiveness of these systems in real-world battlefield scenarios.\n"

In seiner eigenen Theorie unterscheidet er dabei ein Spektrum von Implikation, Irritation, \"Weiser im engeren Sinne\" und qBild (oder quasiBild). Wiener selbst schreibt u.a.: \"„Weiser” soll also recht wohl das bezeichnen, was man umgangssprachlich „Vorstellung” nennt, aber in ausdrücklicher Distanzierung von den erwähnten Ansätzen. Die Distanzierung ist motiviert durch die Arbeits-Hypothese: Im Denken werden nicht Reizkonfigurationen reproduziert, sondern Reaktionen auf Reize. Allein kritische Selbstbeobachtung schon zeigt, daß die Devise „Denken ist ein Manipulieren von Bildern” eine irreführende Metapher ist: das Kontinuum zwischen den Polen „vagste Andeutung” und „lebhafteste Deutlichkeit” ist eigentlich ein Kontinuum der Detailhaltigkeit der jeweils aktuellen Laufumgebung. Ein Weiser ist der Beginn der (Re-)Konstruktion eines solchen Details oder, eigentlich, Detail-Zusammenhangs, er mag als Sinneseindruck imponieren oder nicht.\" ... \" Ein Weiser manifestiert eine bestimmte Situation innerhalb der aktuellen Orientierung. Der Weiser „weist auf” einen Gegenstand, aber er macht den Gegenstand nicht gegenwärtig: gegenwärtig ist eben das jeweilige Weiser-Phänomen, das schwer zu beschreiben ist. Verhältnismäßig leicht hingegen ist – meist – der „Inhalt” des Weisers zu erfassen: Im Allgemeinen kann man den Gegenstand sofort nennen, „auf den das Phänomen weist”. Werden, wie in den alten Experimenten, „Versuchspersonen” zur Selbstbeobachtung gedrängt, so umschreiben sie ihre normalen, unauffälligen Weiser gerne als die Stimmung „Ich weiß Bescheid”, „Ich könnte von hier weiter …”. Man kann meinen, das Gewiesene schon etabliert zu haben, damit schon arbeiten zu können. Und in der Tat reicht dieser im Phänomenalen noch gar nicht entschiedene Zustand in vielen Fällen bereits aus, die Orientierung zu akkommodieren, d. ‌h. auf bestimmte Gegenstände oder Aspekte einzustellen, auf die sie bisher nicht vorbereitet war („Weiser-Denken”). — In vielen anderen Fällen muß der Weiser verstärkt, das heißt erweitert werden, wenn ein gleicher Erfolg erzielt werden soll. Dieses Explizieren nenne ich „Expandieren” (des Weisers), wenn es allein durch Zuwendung von Aufmerksamkeit zu Stande kommt, oder Assemblieren (einer Struktur), wenn der Weiser in eine vorbereitete Laufumgebung, z. ‌B. in eine Aufgabe hinein expandiert wird (wenn die Übereinstimmung mit außerhalb des Weisers vorgegebenen Spezifikationen gewährleistet werden muß).\" ... \"Ein Weiser ist also kein Zeiger. Ein Zeiger ist ja etwas anderes als das, worauf er zeigt, ein Weiser aber ist schon das Gewiesene, in statu nascendi, der Keim einer jeweils bestimmten Struktur, der in seine Umgebung wachsen wird (oder könnte) – der Beginn einer Assemblage.\".

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent information on \"MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs KQL usage in Azure Monitor logs\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nMicrosoft Graph Activity Logs provide an audit trail of HTTP requests made to the Microsoft Graph service for resources in a tenant. Tenant administrators can enable the collection of these logs using diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor. These logs can then be sent to various destinations, including Azure Log Analytics workspace for analysis using Kusto Query Language (KQL), building dashboards, and setting up alerts. They can also be exported to Azure Storage for long-term archival and compliance, or streamed with Azure Event Hubs to external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.\n\n**Key aspects of Microsoft Graph Activity Logs and KQL usage in Azure Monitor Logs:**\n\n*   **Data Captured:** The logs capture comprehensive details about each API request, including the endpoint URI, HTTP method, API version, and the Application Identifier (AppId) of the client application initiating the request. All logs for API requests made from line of business applications, API clients, SDKs, and by Microsoft applications like Outlook, Microsoft Teams, or the Microsoft Entra admin center are available.\n*   **Common Use Cases:** Common use cases include identifying activities conducted by compromised user accounts, building detections and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious or anomalous use of Microsoft Graph APIs, investigating unexpected or suspicious privileged assignment of application permissions, and identifying problematic or unexpected behaviors for client applications.\n*   **Prerequisites:** To access the Microsoft Graph activity logs, a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 tenant license is required. An administrator with a supported Microsoft Entra administrator role, such as Security Administrator, is also needed. An Azure subscription with a configured log destination, such as an Azure Log Analytics workspace, Azure Storage Account, or Azure Event Hubs namespace, is necessary.\n*   **Enabling and Configuring:** Tenant administrators can enable the collection of Microsoft Graph activity logs using diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor. This can be done through the Azure portal or Azure Resource Manager APIs. In the Diagnostic settings page, you need to give a name for the new setting and select the `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs` category.\n*   **KQL Queries:** If you send Microsoft Graph activity logs to a Log Analytics workspace, you can query the logs using Kusto Query Language (KQL). KQL queries can be used for data exploration, building alert rules, creating Azure dashboards, or integrating into custom applications using the Azure Monitor Logs API or Query SDK. Example queries include identifying the top entities making requests, correlating activity logs with sign-in logs, and detecting suspicious activities.\n*   **Limitations:** You can't filter Microsoft Graph activity logs through diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor. However, options are available to reduce costs in Azure Log Analytics Workspace, such as workspace transformations or switching to the Basic log data plan. The Microsoft Graph activity logs feature allows the tenant administrators to collect logs for the resource tenant, and it doesn't allow you to see the activities of a multitenant application in another tenant.\n*   **Schema:** The Microsoft Graph documentation defines the schema of the logs. The logs are stored in Log Analytics for analysis. Key columns for detection and forensics include AppId, IPAddress, RequestId, RequestMethod, RequestUri, Roles, Scopes, ServicePrincipalId, UserAgent, and UserId.\n*   **Cost Reduction:** Workspace transformations can be used to reduce costs in Azure Log Analytics Workspace. An alternative approach to reduce Log Analytics cost is to switch to the Basic log data plan which lowers the bills by providing reduced capabilities.\n*   **PowerShell Integration:** The Azure PowerShell SDK can be used to embed KQL queries into scripts to automate log retrieval and analysis.\n"

These logs offer detailed insights into user and application behavior, which can be leveraged to detect suspicious activities and investigate compromised accounts. They can be enabled via diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor and sent to various destinations, including Azure Log Analytics workspace for analysis using Kusto Query Language (KQL).\n\nHere are examples of how KQL queries can be used with Microsoft Graph Activity Logs:\n\n**Detecting Suspicious Activities:**\n\n*   **AzureHound Detection:** This query detects potential AzureHound executions by filtering on GET requests with status 200, counting the number of bytes retrieved, and the number of unique requests executed within an hour.\n*   **Privilege Abuse:** Identify Entra applications that have accesses with high-impact permissions. This involves creating a safe list of approved applications and continuously monitoring high privileged accesses to detect potential security threats.\n*   **Data Exfiltration:** This query helps investigate Microsoft Graph API calls related to download activities. Analyzing the UserAgent and AppID can help determine whether these activities are expected.\n*   **Unusual User Agent:** Building a list of known User Agents per entity and comparing those to current data may help identify anomalies.\n*   **Detecting AzureHound executions:** Detect potential AzureHound executions by filtering on GET requests with status 200 since AzureHound is a collector that submits GET requests to retrieve the data.\n\n**Investigating Compromised Accounts:**\n\n*   **General Activity Audit:** Establish a timeline of a user's recent activity to identify anomalies such as access from unknown applications, unusual IP addresses, or devices that the user doesn't typically use.\n    *   This KQL query retrieves all Graph API requests made on behalf of a specific user within the past 24 hours:\n\n```kql\nMicrosoftGraphActivityLogs\n| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)\n| where UserId == \"<UserPrincipalName>\"\n| project TimeGenerated, AppId, RequestMethod, RequestUri, ResponseStatusCode, IPAddress\n| sort by TimeGenerated desc\n```\n\n*Replace `<UserPrincipalName>` with the actual user's email or ID.*\n\n*   **Correlate with Sign-in Logs:** Correlate Microsoft Graph requests made by a user or app with sign-in information.\n*   **Identify Activities:** Identify the activities that a compromised user account conducted in your tenant.\n*   **Mailbox Breaches:** Hunt for common indicators of mailbox compromise, identify suspicious access patterns, and detect malicious inbox rules.\n\n**Additional KQL Queries:**\n\n*   **Top 20 App Instances by Request Count:** This query identifies the top 20 app instances by request count in the last 7 days:\n\n```kql\nMicrosoftGraphActivityLogs\n| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)\n| summarize RequestCount=count() by AppId, IpAddress, UserAgent\n| sort by RequestCount\n| limit 20\n```\n\n*   **Discover Requests Failed Due to Authorization:** This query helps discover requests that failed due to authorization in the last day:\n\n```kql\nMicrosoftGraphActivityLogs\n| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)\n| where ResponseStatusCode == 401 or ResponseStatusCode == 403\n| project TimeGenerated, AppId, RequestUri, ResponseStatusCode\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Microsoft Graph activity logs are not collected by default and must be configured via Azure Monitor's diagnostic settings.\n*   To use Microsoft Entra logs with Azure Monitor, a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 tenant and a Log Analytics workspace in your Azure subscription are required.\n*   The `RequestUri` field can be parsed using the `parse_url()` function to make it easier to query and analyze.\n*   Correlating MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs with other logs, such as IdentityInfo, can provide additional context. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) needs to be enabled for data to appear in IdentityInfo.\n*   Be aware of the limitations of the logs, such as the fact that other APIs are not part of this log.\n"

Нейрон Маккалока-Питтса (MCP):**\n\n*   Это упрощенная математическая модель биологического нейрона, предложенная в 1943 году нейрофизиологом Уорреном Маккалоком и логиком Уолтером Питтсом [envisioning](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [rmb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). Эта модель является первой формальной моделью нейронных сетей [machinelearning](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n*   Он считается основополагающей концепцией в области искусственного интеллекта и заложил основу для разработки искусственных нейронных сетей [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3) [envisioning](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4).

Один нейрон состоит из трех частей: сомы (обрабатывает сигналы), дендритов (получают сигналы) и аксона (отправляет сигналы) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [rmb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). Нейрон состоит из сумматора и активационной функции [machinelearning](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n*   Нейрон MCP может моделировать логические элементы, такие как AND, OR и NOT, путем указания весов и порога [rmb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n*   Ограничения нейрона MCP включают работу только с двоичными входами, необходимость ручной установки порогового значения и придание одинаковой важности всем функциям [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5). В нейроне Маккалока-Питтса отсутствуют изменяемые синаптические веса [machinelearning](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n*   Позже были представлены более сложные нейронные сети, такие как персептроны, алгоритмы обратного распространения, сверточные нейронные сети (CNN) и рекуррентные нейронные сети (RNN), чтобы преодолеть эти ограничения [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4).\n\n**2.

McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) Neuron:**\n\n*   The McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) neuron is a simplified mathematical model of a biological neuron, proposed in 1943 by neurophysiologist Warren S. McCulloch and logician Walter Pitts.\n*   It is considered a foundational concept in the field of AI and laid the groundwork for the development of artificial neural networks.\n*   The MCP neuron receives binary inputs (0s and 1s), takes a weighted sum of these inputs, and outputs a 1 if the weighted sum is at least some threshold value, or a 0 otherwise.\n*   The connections between neurons are known as synapses. A single neuron consists of three parts: Soma (processes signals), Dendrites (receive signals), and Axon (sends signals).\n*   The MCP neuron can model logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT by specifying weights and a threshold.\n*   Limitations of the MCP neuron include working only with binary inputs, requiring manual setting of the threshold value, and giving equal importance to all features.\n*   Later, more complex neural networks such as perceptrons, backpropagation algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were introduced to overcome these limitations.\n\n**2. Model Context Protocol (MCP):**\n\n*   The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard, open-source framework introduced by Anthropic in November 2024.\n*   It standardizes the way AI systems, like large language models (LLMs), integrate and share data with external tools, systems, and data sources.\n*   MCP enables AI agents to access external tools and data sources to take action more effectively.\n*   It provides a standard way to make information available to LLMs, similar to how an API works.\n*   MCP supports agentic AI, enabling AI programs to incorporate new information sources into their decision-making and connect to external tools.\n*   MCP uses a client-server architecture, where the AI agent (client) sends requests to servers, which respond.\n*   MCP allows AI to perform multi-step tasks such as retrieving data, saving files, and sending emails.\n*   MCP is model-agnostic, meaning it is designed to work with any machine learning model architecture, regardless of its type, framework, or internal structure.\n*   Key components of MCP include hosts, clients, and servers. Hosts are AI models or apps, clients facilitate the connection with servers, and servers connect to data sources or tools.\n*   MCP helps minimize token usage by delivering lean, targeted data.\n"

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct Google Searches to gather the most recent information on \"How does the Model Context Protocol (MCP) handle authentication and authorization for accessing external tools and data sources?\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging open standard that allows AI systems to interact with external tools and data sources in a standardized way. It acts as a universal adapter, enabling AI models to seamlessly communicate with external tools, data sources, and services. MCP defines how to connect Large Language Models (LLMs) to external tools. MCP is designed to be flexible; servers can expose tools, and clients (often LLMs) can invoke them based on descriptions.\n\nHere's how MCP handles authentication and authorization for accessing external tools and data sources:\n\n**1. Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:**\n\n*   **OAuth 2.1:** MCP defines authorization using OAuth 2.1, enabling MCP clients and servers to delegate authorization. MCP servers implementing the new specification can authorize users to perform specific tasks and actions on existing services built on top of OAuth such as Auth0, Google APIs, GitHub, etc.\n*   **API Keys:** A common practice in MCP implementations is using API keys to authenticate the AI model or client to access the server. The key acts as an identifier for the model, ensuring that only authorized clients can initiate API calls. This method is only recommended for MCP servers using the stdio transport.\n*   **Environment Variables:** MCP servers use environment variables for authentication. API keys and tokens are passed through the config.\n*   **Dynamic Client Registration:** MCP clients and authorization servers *should* support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (RFC7591) to allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction.\n\n**2. The MCP Authorization Flow (Utilizing OAuth 2.1):**\n\n1.  MCP client initiates a standard OAuth flow with the MCP server.\n2.  The MCP server redirects the user to a third-party authorization server.\n3.  The user authorizes with the third-party server.\n4.  The third-party server redirects back to the MCP server with the authorization code.\n5.  MCP server exchanges the code for a third-party access token.\n6.  MCP server generates its own access token bound to the third-party session.\n7.  MCP server completes the original OAuth flow with the MCP client.\n\n**3. Security Considerations and Best Practices:**\n\n*   **User Consent:** Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers and must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent.\n*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** MCP servers should execute actions on behalf of the user and with the user's permission. If not implemented correctly, a user could gain access to resources that should not be available to them but that are available to the MCP server, violating the principle of least privilege.\n*   **Input/Output Validation:** Security for agent-tool protocols must start with strong authentication, scoped permissions, and input/output validation.\n*   **Auditing MCP Servers:** Check for command injection, path traversal, and authentication issues.\n*   **Limiting Permissions:** Run servers with minimal required access.\n*   **Monitoring Activity:** Log all tool invocations and review them.\n*   **Human Approval:** Require confirmation for sensitive operations.\n*   **Tool-Level Authorization:** Users must explicitly approve each client-tool pair, with support for per-resource granularity helping to fulfill the principle of keeping the user in control.\n*   **Secure Storage:** Tokens sit in config files or memory. If someone compromises the server, they get all your tokens.\n\n**4. Security Risks:**\n\n*   **\"Confused Deputy\" Problem:** When an MCP server performs an action triggered by a user's request, there is a risk of a \"confused deputy\" problem.\n*   **Prompt Injection:** MCP servers pose significant security risks due to their ability to execute commands and perform API calls.\n*   **Malicious Servers:** A rogue server in the mix can mimic or modify the responses of genuine services and lead the AI astray.\n*   **Lack of Authentication and Access Control:** If the MCP ecosystem isn't locked down, an attacker could connect to unauthorized tools or access resources beyond what's intended.\n*   **Command Injection:** Many MCP servers have basic security flaws.\n*   **Token Theft:** MCP servers store OAuth tokens for services like Gmail. If someone compromises the server, they get all your tokens.\n*   **Server Spoofing:**.\n\n**5. Windows 11 Security Architecture:**\n\n*   Provides a baseline set of security requirements that all MCP server developers must meet to help ensure user safety.\n*   The user is in control for all security-sensitive operations done on their behalf.\n*   The principle of least privilege must be enforced to contain the impact of any possible attack on an MCP server.\n\n**6. Optional Authorization:**\n\n*   Authorization is *optional* for MCP implementations. When supported, implementations using an HTTP-based transport *should* conform to the specification. Implementations using an STDIO transport *should not* follow this specification and instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\n\n**7. Key Benefits of MCP:**\n\n*   **Interoperability:** A common language reduces complex custom integrations.\n*   **Real-Time Context:** AI models query MCP servers for live, up-to-date information.\n*   **Extensibility:** AI agents can easily connect to a growing ecosystem of MCP-enabled tools and data.\n*   **Enhanced Security:** MCP facilitates secure, auditable access to resources.\n*   **Development Efficiency:** Build an MCP server once, and many AI agents can use it.\n\n**8. MCP Components:**\n\n*   **MCP Host:** An AI application that needs external data or actions.\n*   **MCP Client:** Within the Host, it discovers and communicates with an MCP Server.\n*   **MCP Server:** A wrapper around a specific tool, database, or API, exposing its functions and data in a standardized way.\n"

          "output": "The performance benefits of using Multi-Chip Packages (MCP) compared to other integration methods in AI systems stem from several key advantages related to latency, throughput, and overall efficiency. MCP's advantages are especially pronounced in demanding AI applications that require substantial computational power and memory bandwidth.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the specific performance benefits:\n\n**Reduced Latency:**\n\n*   **Shorter Interconnects:** MCP designs, particularly those using 2.5D and 3D integration, minimize the distance data needs to travel between chips. By placing memory and logic chips closer together, the interconnect lengths are significantly reduced, leading to lower latency. For example, High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) which is often integrated using advanced packaging, is placed close to the GPU, resulting in millimeter-level or shorter interconnects.\n*   **Lower Latency than Traditional APIs:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) can reduce latency in AI applications. For instance, integrating AI-powered chatbots with CRM systems using MCP ensures rapid data retrieval, speeding up response times and enhancing customer satisfaction. MCP servers have demonstrated a 30% reduction in average response time compared to custom integrations, achieving an average response time of 50 milliseconds.\n*   **Real-time Data Access:** MCP provides real-time access to external data sources, which enhances the context awareness of AI models and leads to more accurate and useful outcomes. MCP retrieves data in real time, reducing the risk of incorrect or stale responses.\n\n**Increased Throughput:**\n\n*   **Higher Memory Bandwidth:** MCPs, especially those incorporating HBM, offer substantially higher memory bandwidth compared to traditional memory architectures like DDR4 and GDDR5. HBM achieves this by stacking memory vertically and using Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) for interconnection. For example, NVIDIA's H100 SXM5 GPU with HBM3 delivers up to 3TB/s of memory bandwidth, enabling rapid data movement.\n*   **Enhanced Parallel Processing:** The high bandwidth provided by MCPs allows thousands of GPU cores to access memory simultaneously with minimal contention. This is particularly beneficial for transformer-based models like LLMs and computer vision networks processing high-resolution images.\n*   **Improved Data Transfer Rates:** High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) delivers exceptional data transfer rates, which is critical for real-time applications such as high-end gaming and AI inference, where rapid data movement minimizes latency.\n*   **Scalability:** MCP's standardized architecture, real-time communication, and dynamic discovery features make it an attractive choice for companies looking to simplify their integration processes and improve the efficiency and reliability of their AI systems. MCP supports dynamic scaling through horizontal server deployments and intelligent load balancing, ensuring consistent performance even during usage spikes.\n\n**Other Performance Benefits:**\n\n*   **Improved Energy Efficiency:** MCP designs, particularly those with HBM, often exhibit better energy efficiency compared to traditional planar memory designs. Stacking memory vertically reduces the distance data must travel, resulting in lower power consumption per bit transferred.\n*   **Better Performance for Large Models:** Modern AI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and bandwidth. MCPs with HBM can handle these demanding workloads more effectively by reducing memory bottlenecks during training, enabling larger batch sizes for improved throughput, and supporting bigger model architectures without excessive partitioning.\n*   **Reduced Computational Overhead:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) reduces the computational burden by allowing models to request only the necessary data in real time, cutting down on computation costs and improving performance.\n*   **Faster Training Times:** HBM's high bandwidth significantly accelerates the training process for LLMs, allowing researchers and developers to iterate on models more quickly.\n*   **Compact Form Factor:** Advanced packaging enables higher transistor densities, improving device functionality while meeting the increasing demand for smaller form factors.\n*   **Simplified Development and Maintenance:** MCP simplifies development and reduces maintenance because developers don't need to maintain separate API connectors for every external system.\n*   **Cost Reduction:** The adoption of MCP can reduce initial development time and ongoing maintenance costs.\n\n**Advanced Packaging Technologies:**\n\n*   **2.5D Integration:** This involves placing multiple semiconductor dies on a silicon interposer, allowing high-speed interconnections. It provides lower latency, higher bandwidth, and reduced power consumption compared to conventional multi-chip modules (MCMs).\n*   **3D Stacking:** This vertically integrates multiple dies using Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) and wafer-to-wafer bonding, reducing data transmission delays, lowering power dissipation, and increasing computational density.\n\nWhile MCP offers numerous advantages, it's important to note potential drawbacks:\n\n*   **Variable Performance:** Some MCP servers may introduce significant latency, particularly when interacting with slow external services.\n*   **Complexity:** Implementing MCP can add a reasoning layer that introduces latency as the model decides how to use tools.\n*   **Potential Fragmentation:** Without strong centralized governance, different companies could create incompatible versions of the protocol.\n\nOverall, MCP offers significant performance benefits for AI systems, including reduced latency, increased throughput, improved energy efficiency, and better scalability. These advantages make MCP an attractive choice for companies looking to simplify their integration processes and improve the efficiency and reliability of their AI systems.\n"

It standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs), acting as a universal interface layer that makes any digital tool accessible to AI systems through natural language commands. However, this increased connectivity introduces security risks. Several vulnerabilities and risks have been identified, along with corresponding mitigation measures.\n\n**Known Security Vulnerabilities and Risks**\n\n*   **Prompt Injection:** MCP servers contain prompt repositories that can be misused to cause AI to behave in undesired or malicious ways. Attackers can insert hidden instructions into upstream data, like tickets or documents, to manipulate LLM outputs. Regularly sanitize and validate AI inputs and implement comprehensive prompt monitoring strategies to mitigate this.\n*   **Credential Exposure:** MCP servers facilitate connections with external systems, requiring credentials such as API keys. Storing these credentials can lead to exposure. Securely store credentials using encryption and regularly audit MCP settings to prevent data leaks.\n*   **Unverified Third-Party Tools:** The availability of numerous MCP servers allows developers to download them from the internet, potentially introducing unverified code that handles sensitive traffic.\n*   **\"Shadow MCP\" Servers:** These are MCP servers installed on organizational resources without the knowledge of security teams, operating outside established security controls and monitoring frameworks. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, unintended actions, and exploitation by attackers.\n*   **Poisoned Tool Descriptions:** Attackers can embed malicious commands within tool descriptions, which are directly loaded into an AI model's operational context. Routinely review and validate all MCP tool metadata, ensuring authenticity and integrity to mitigate this.\n*   **Overprivileged Tool Scopes:** MCP tools often request overly broad permissions, escalating potential damage from breaches. Clearly define the permissions that the MCP server has to access the resource/service it connects to, using the minimum required permissions.\n*   **Insecure Authentication:** Lack of robust authentication mechanisms allows attackers to introduce rogue servers, hijack connections, or steal credentials.\n*   **Lack of Unique Tool Identifiers:** Attackers can create malicious tools with names identical or similar to legitimate ones. Enforce strict naming conventions and \"pin\" tools to their trusted origins.\n*   **Command Injection:** MCP servers may have basic security flaws, such as passing unvalidated user or external inputs to underlying databases or system commands, leading to command or SQL injection. Enforce strict input validation, apply security patches promptly, and use parameterized queries to avoid injection attacks.\n*   **Token Theft:** MCP servers store OAuth tokens for services, and if compromised, attackers can steal these tokens to access sensitive data.\n*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can obtain session IDs and use them to make unauthorized calls to the MCP server. MCP servers must use secure, non-deterministic session IDs and bind them to user-specific information to prevent this.\n*   **Unauthenticated Access to Model Context Endpoints:** Some systems expose MCP endpoints with little or no authentication, allowing attackers to query or manipulate sensitive data.\n*   **Insecure Context Serialization:** Poor input validation during context serialization lets attackers inject malicious or malformed data.\n*   **Supply Chain Risks:** Using open-source or internal MCP implementations without security review can introduce unverified code.\n*   **Rug Pull Attacks:** MCP tools may initially appear legitimate but suddenly become malicious after gaining user trust. Use strict sandboxing and continuous behavior monitoring of MCP tools.\n*   **Denial of Wallet/Service:** MCPs are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** MCPs are vulnerable to authentication bypass.\n*   **RCE Vulnerabilities:** A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-6514) in the `mcp-remote` project allows attackers to trigger arbitrary OS command execution on the machine running `mcp-remote` when it connects to an untrusted MCP server. Another critical RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-49596) in Anthropic's MCP Inspector project could allow an attacker to gain complete access to hosts.\n*   **SQL Injection Bug:** An unpatched SQL injection bug in Anthropic's SQLite MCP server could be exploited to seed malicious prompts, exfiltrate data, and take control of agent workflows.\n*   **Missing Secure by Design:** MCP was designed primarily for functionality rather than security, creating fundamental vulnerabilities.\n\n**Mitigation Measures**\n\n*   **Secure Session IDs:** MCP servers MUST use secure, non-deterministic session IDs generated by secure random number generators. Avoid predictable or sequential session identifiers.\n*   **Authorization Verification:** MCP servers that implement authorization MUST verify all inbound requests. MCP Servers MUST NOT use sessions for authentication.\n*   **User Consent:** MCP proxy servers using static client IDs MUST obtain user consent for each dynamically registered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers.\n*   **Token Validation:** Validate that tokens were properly issued to the MCP server. Verify the `aud` (audience) claim matches your MCP server's identifier on every incoming token. Reject tokens that lack required scopes or contain unexpected claims.\n*   **Least Privilege:** Enforce least-privilege RBAC, giving each MCP integration its own fine-grained role or policy, scoped strictly to the permissions it needs. Avoid \"root\" tokens.\n*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Treat MCP clients and servers like any other application: validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and guard against injection attacks.\n*   **Static Analysis and SCA:** Run linters, SAST tools, and software composition analysis on your MCP code and dependencies. Block builds if high-severity issues are found.\n*   **Regular Updates and Patch Management:** Keep MCP server software and dependencies up to date. Automate updates and schedule regular security audits.\n*   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Impose rate limits on the number of requests each user can send.\n*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement a robust monitoring and logging system. Use a centralized logging solution and configure alerts for anomalies.\n*   **Server Hardening:** Use MFA where possible, keep patching up to date, and integrate the server with a third-party identity provider for access.\n*   **Zero Trust Architecture:** Isolate components via network and identity controls to minimize lateral movement if an AI application were compromised.\n*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Implement user confirmation prompts for sensitive operations. Provide real-time visibility to the user when a tool is being used.\n*   **Sandboxing and Resource Limits:** Enforce limits on what the AI can do, such as maximum file size or CPU time. Run code execution tools in a secure sandbox or container with strict resource controls.\n*   **Defense-in-Depth:** Implement a layered approach to security, including prompt sanitization, DLP and output filtering, sandboxed tools, config hardening, auditable logs, MFA, and trusted registry enforcement.\n*   **Secure Connection Methods:** Connect only to trusted MCP servers using secure connection methods (HTTPS).\n*   **Integrate with Governance Frameworks:** Integrate MCP security with existing governance frameworks, applying the same rules to AI access as to API access.\n*   **Threat Modeling:** Systematically analyze how an AI+MCP system could be attacked and ensure controls cover those scenarios.\n\nOrganizations should carefully consider the security implications of MCP and implement robust security controls. The standardization efforts around MCP must prioritize security alongside functionality to prevent creating a new generation of vulnerable AI systems.\n"

          "output": "As of July 16, 2025, the US tariff landscape is complex and has seen significant changes throughout the year. Here's a summary of the key developments:\n\n**Overall Tariff Rates:**\n\n*   **Average Effective Tariff Rate:** Consumers are facing an overall average effective tariff rate of 20.6%, which is the highest since 1910. After shifts in consumption, this rate is expected to be around 19.7%, the highest since 1933.\n*   **Increase in Tariff Rate:** The tariffs implemented in 2025 represent a 17.3 percentage point increase in the US average effective tariff rate.\n*   **Price Impact:** These tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices by 2.1% in the short run, which translates to an average loss of $2,800 per household in 2025. After consumption shifts, the price increase is expected to settle at 1.8%, or a $2,300 loss per household.\n*   **GDP and Employment Effects:** The tariffs are projected to lower US real GDP growth over 2025 by 0.9 percentage points. The unemployment rate is expected to rise by 0.5 percentage points by the end of 2025, with a loss of 641,000 payroll jobs.\n\n**Specific Tariff Measures:**\n\n*   **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs:** A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports was implemented on March 12, 2025. This was later increased to 50% for all countries except the United Kingdom, which remained at 25%, effective June 4, 2025.\n*   **Automobile Tariffs:** A 25% tariff was implemented on all imported automobiles and automobile parts.\n*   **China Tariffs:** In early April 2025, the US increased tariff rates on imports from China, Hong Kong, and Macau to 125%. However, following a trade agreement, the US reduced its tariffs to 30%. Tariffs on Chinese *de minimis* shipments were lowered to 54%.\n*   **Reciprocal Tariffs:** A flat 10% tariff was applied to imports from most countries, effective April 10, 2025. New country-specific tariff rates, ranging from 25% to 40%, are scheduled to take effect on August 1, 2025, for countries that the US considers to have trade barriers or imbalanced practices.\n*   **Tariffs on Smaller Nations:** Tariffs exceeding 10% are planned for over 100 smaller nations, primarily in Africa and the Caribbean, with a uniform rate likely to be applied.\n\n**Legal and Policy Context:**\n\n*   **IEEPA Tariffs:** President Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs. However, federal courts ruled this use of the IEEPA unconstitutional, though the decisions were stayed pending appeal. Oral arguments on the appeals are scheduled for July 31, 2025.\n*   **\"America First\" Trade Policy:** The Trump administration's trade policy prioritizes domestic investment and productivity, defends US economic and national security interests, and aims to benefit American workers and businesses.\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n*   **Retaliatory Tariffs:** Several countries, including the EU, Canada, and China, have imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods in response to the US tariffs.\n*   **De Minimis Exemption:** The *de minimis* exemption for Chinese-made goods remains eliminated.\n*   **USMCA:** Goods compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) are generally exempt from tariffs.\n\nIt's important to note that the US trade policy landscape is constantly evolving, and further changes are possible.\n"

These tariffs have broad implications for consumers, businesses, and international trade relations.\n\n**Key Tariff Measures in 2025:**\n\n*   **Across-the-board Tariffs:** In early April 2025, President Trump announced \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from most countries, citing a national emergency over the trade deficit. This included a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all imports, effective April 5. Additional country-specific tariffs, ranging from 11% to 50%, were planned for countries with the largest trade deficits with the U.S. However, a 90-day pause was implemented on these country-specific tariffs, with a universal 10% rate applying to most countries.\n*   **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs:** A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports was implemented on March 12, 2025. On June 4, 2025, this tariff increased to 50% for all countries except the United Kingdom, which remained at 25%.\n*   **Tariffs on Specific Countries:**\n    *   **China:** Tariffs on Chinese goods have fluctuated. In April 2025, tariffs on goods from China, Hong Kong, and Macau increased to 125%, resulting in a total tariff rate of 145% when combined with previous tariffs. However, a temporary trade agreement in May 2025 reduced these tariffs to 30%.\n    *   **Canada and Mexico:** In February 2025, a 25% additional tariff was imposed on imports from Canada and Mexico, citing an emergency situation related to illegal immigration and drugs. However, goods compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) were later exempted.\n    *   **EU and Mexico:** In July 2025, President Trump announced 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico, set to take effect on August 1.\n    *   **Vietnam:** A trade deal was reached in July 2025, with the U.S. imposing a 20% tariff on most Vietnamese exports and a 40% levy on goods transshipped through Vietnam.\n    *   **Indonesia:** In July 2025, President Trump announced a trade accord with Indonesia, including a 19% tariff rate on Indonesian exports to the U.S.\n*   **Other Tariffs:** A 25% tariff on imported cars was announced in March 2025. Additionally, a 17% tariff was imposed on fresh tomatoes from Mexico in July 2025.\n\n**Economic Impacts:**\n\n*   **Price Increases:** The tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices. One analysis suggests a 2.1% increase in consumer prices in the short-run, equating to an average household income loss of $2,800 per year. Another analysis from July 10, 2025, estimates the price level from all 2025 tariffs to rise by 1.8% in the short-run, which is equivalent to a $2,400 loss per household.\n*   **GDP and Employment:** Tariffs are projected to negatively impact U.S. real GDP growth. One estimate suggests a 0.9 percentage point reduction in GDP growth in 2025. The unemployment rate is also expected to rise, with a potential loss of 641,000 payroll jobs.\n*   **Sectoral Effects:** While tariffs may lead to expansion in U.S. manufacturing output, other sectors like construction and agriculture are expected to contract. Clothing and textiles are particularly affected, with potentially higher prices for consumers.\n*   **Trade Relations:** The tariffs have led to retaliatory measures from other countries, such as the EU's tariffs on select U.S. goods. These actions have created trade tensions and complicated international trade relations.\n\n**Legal and Political Landscape:**\n\n*   **Legal Challenges:** Some of President Trump's tariffs have faced legal challenges. For example, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) were unlawful. However, these rulings were stayed pending appeal, allowing the tariffs to remain in effect.\n*   **Congressional Response:** Some members of Congress have opposed President Trump's tariffs.\n\n**Overall, the U.S. tariff landscape in July 2025 is characterized by:**\n\n*   High average tariff rates, reaching levels not seen in decades.\n*   Frequent changes and adjustments to tariff policies.\n*   Significant economic impacts, including price increases, reduced GDP growth, and shifts in employment across sectors.\n*   Ongoing legal and political debates surrounding the use of tariffs.\n*   Strained trade relations with key trading partners.\n"

Following some policy rollbacks, it was estimated at 15.8% as of June 2025. However, more recent analysis from The Budget Lab (TBL) at Yale estimated an average effective tariff rate of 20.6% as of July 13, 2025, the highest since 1910. After accounting for consumption shifts, the average tariff rate is projected to be 19.7%, the highest since 1933.\n*   **\"Liberation Day\" Tariffs:** On April 2, 2025, former President Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from countries not subject to other sanctions. A universal 10% tariff took effect on April 5.\n*   **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs:** Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have fluctuated, reaching 50% for most countries as of June 4, 2025, with the exception of the UK, which remained at 25%.\n*   **China Trade War:** The US-China trade war saw baseline US tariffs on Chinese goods peaking at 145%, with China retaliating with tariffs on U.S. goods reaching 125%. A temporary agreement in May 2025 reduced these to 30% and 10%, respectively, for a 90-day period.\n*   **EU and Mexico Tariffs:** Trump announced 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico, scheduled to take effect on August 1, 2025.\n*   **Legal Challenges:** Several federal courts have challenged the legality of Trump's tariffs, particularly those imposed under the IEEPA. While some rulings have temporarily blocked the tariffs, appeals have stayed these decisions, keeping the tariffs in effect pending further court review. Oral arguments on appeals are scheduled for July 31, 2025.\n*   **Reciprocal Tariffs:** The Trump administration has expressed a preference for \"reciprocal tariffs,\" aiming to match the tariff rates imposed by other countries on US goods.\n*   **Sector-Specific Tariffs:** Besides broad tariffs, the administration has targeted specific sectors, including steel, aluminum, automobiles, and potentially copper and iPhones.\n*   **Tomato Tariffs:** The U.S. Department of Commerce withdrew from a 2019 agreement with Mexico that suspended an antidumping duty investigation on Mexican tomatoes. Most fresh tomato imports from Mexico will now face a 17.09% tariff.\n\n**Economic Impacts:**\n\n*   **Price Increases:** The 2025 tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices. TBL estimated a short-run increase of 2.1%, equivalent to an average household income loss of $2,800 per year. Another TBL analysis from July 10, 2025, estimated a 1.8% increase, or $2,400 per household.\n*   **GDP Reduction:** TBL estimated that US real GDP growth in 2025 would be 0.9 percentage points lower due to the tariffs. In the long run, the US economy is projected to be 0.5% smaller, equivalent to $135 billion annually.\n*   **Job Losses:** The tariffs are projected to raise the unemployment rate by 0.5 percentage points by the end of 2025, with a loss of 641,000 payroll jobs.\n*   **Sectoral Shifts:** While US manufacturing output may expand, other sectors like construction and agriculture are expected to contract.\n*   **Trade Deficit:** The tariffs are intended to reduce the United States' trade deficit and enhance U.S. manufacturing.\n*   **Fiscal Effects:** All tariffs in 2025 are estimated to raise $3.0 trillion over 2026-35, but negative dynamic revenue effects could reduce this to $2.5 trillion.\n*   **Impact on Specific Goods:** Consumers may face significantly higher prices for clothing and textiles, with potential short-run increases of 44% for shoes and 40% for apparel.\n\n**Reactions and Responses:**\n\n*   **Economists' Concerns:** Many economists and former government officials have expressed concerns that the tariff policies will harm the US economy.\n*   **Retaliation:** Trading partners have retaliated with their own tariffs on US exports.\n*   **Trade Negotiations:** The US is engaged in trade negotiations with various countries, with the threat of tariffs being used as leverage.\n\n**Ongoing Issues:**\n\n*   **Enforcement Actions:** The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is actively involved in enforcing trade agreements and addressing unfair trade practices.\n*   **Trade Deficit Concerns:** The Trump administration views large trade deficits as a threat to national security and the economy, justifying the use of tariffs.\n*   **Uncertainty:** The frequent changes and adjustments to tariff policies have created uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\n"

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on \"historical significance of Place Stanislas, Place de la Carrière, and Place d'Alliance in Nancy within human history\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nThe Place Stanislas, Place de la Carrière, and Place d'Alliance in Nancy, France, form a UNESCO World Heritage Site recognized in 1983 as a masterpiece of 18th-century town planning. This architectural ensemble exemplifies the concept of a royal square as a central, monumental urban space during the Age of Enlightenment.\n\n**Place Stanislas:** Built between 1752 and 1756 by Stanisław Leszczyński, the former King of Poland and Duke of Lorraine, to link the medieval old town and the \"new\" town of Nancy. The square was designed by Emmanuel Héré to honor Stanislas' son-in-law, Louis XV. It is known for its harmonious proportions, classical architecture, and wrought-iron railings decorated with gold leaf by Jean Lamour. The square has been used for public assemblies and festivities throughout its history. A statue of Stanislas was placed in the middle of the square in 1831, replacing a former statue of Louis XV. The City Hall, the Grand Hotel, the Nancy Opera House, and the Museum of Fine Arts surround the square.\n\n**Place de la Carrière:** This square dates back to the mid-16th century and was initially used for jousting, tournaments, and equestrian games. It was later remodeled by Stanislas Leszczynski in the 18th century. Place de la Carrière is an extension of Place Stanislas, connecting it to the Palais du Gouvernement. The Palais du Gouvernement closes off the square to the north.\n\n**Place d'Alliance:** Created in 1751 on the site of the ducal vegetable garden. It was initially intended to be dedicated to Saint Stanislas but was later renamed to commemorate the Franco-Austrian Alliance Treaty of 1756. Emmanuel Héré designed the square. Place d'Alliance is the smallest and most intimate of the three squares. A fountain sculpted by Paul-Louis Cyfflé stands at the heart of the square, originally intended for Place de la Carrière. The fountain's design was inspired by Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers in Rome's Piazza Navona.\n"

          "output": "Place Stanislas, Place de la Carrière, and Place d'Alliance in Nancy, France, form a monumental ensemble that has significantly influenced urban development and architectural styles in Europe and beyond. These three squares, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, represent an exceptional example of 18th-century urban planning, embodying a harmonious architectural vision that unifies the old medieval town with the newer districts.\n\n**Key Aspects of Influence:**\n\n*   **Urban Planning and Design:** Conceived by Stanislas Leszczyński, the former King of Poland and Duke of Lorraine, the squares were designed to link Nancy's old and new towns, creating a unified and modernized urban center. The design created a large urban square that linked two handsome existing buildings: the Hôtel de Ville (city hall, now centred on its grand square) and the Hôtel du Gouvernement, the seat of the duchy. This innovative approach to urban design, implemented between 1752 and 1756, served as a model for subsequent urban developments in Europe. The squares exemplify the concept of a royal square as a central and monumental urban space.\n*   **Architectural Style:** The architectural layout of Place Stanislas is a masterpiece of urban design. The square and the surrounding buildings, unified by their colossal orders, were designed by the royal architect Emmanuel Héré de Corny. The buildings surrounding Place Stanislas showcase a consistent neoclassical style, blending classical architecture with Rococo and Baroque elements. The facades are adorned with elegant balconies and intricate stonework. This architectural ensemble, featuring elements like the Arc Héré (a triumphal arch inspired by the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome), influenced the design of public spaces and buildings in other European cities.\n*   **Artistic Elements:** The squares are adorned with artistic elements such as gilded wrought-iron gates and lanterns created by Jean Lamour, and fountains sculpted by Barthélémy Guibal. These features, including the statue of Stanislas Leszczyński at the heart of Place Stanislas, contribute to the squares' aesthetic appeal and have inspired similar artistic embellishments in urban spaces elsewhere. The wrought-iron gates have given Nancy the nickname \"City with Golden Gates\".\n*   **Integration of Functionality:** Beyond their aesthetic value, the squares were designed to be functional, housing administrative, judicial, religious, and cultural institutions. This integration of public spaces and buildings contributed to the creation of an active and lively urban center, influencing the planning of other European cities.\n*   **Influence on European Urbanism:** UNESCO recognized the ensemble's integrity, authenticity, and influence on European urbanism when it was designated a World Heritage Site. The squares' design drew inspiration from French urbanism principles perfected at Versailles, particularly the use of space to guide the viewer's gaze and orchestrate a visual promenade.\n\nPlace Stanislas, Place de la Carrière, and Place d'Alliance stand as a testament to the vision of Stanislas Leszczyński and the skill of architect Emmanuel Héré, leaving a lasting legacy on urban planning and architectural styles in Europe and beyond. The ensemble's harmonious design, integration of functionality, and artistic embellishments have served as an inspiration for the creation of public spaces and buildings in other cities, solidifying its importance in the history of urbanism.\n"

          "output": "Common issues encountered when using MathJax for rendering LaTeX in Markdown and their solutions, as of July 16, 2025, are:\n\n**1. Rendering Errors and Configuration Issues:**\n\n*   **Incorrect delimiters:** Using incorrect delimiters for inline math (e.g., not using `$ ... $`) or display math (e.g., not using `$$ ... $$`) can cause rendering failures.\n*   **Whitespace errors:** Extra spaces immediately inside the delimiters (e.g., `$ E=mc^2 $` instead of `$E=mc^2$`) is a common issue.\n*   **Using code blocks for math:** Wrapping LaTeX in Markdown code fences (e.g., ``latex ... ``) prevents math renderers from processing it.\n*   **Single dollar signs:** MathJax does not treat a pair of single dollars as an inline math expression by default (only `\\(` and `\\)` work). You can enable the `$...$` -style inline mode by inserting specific code into the `<head>` section of your HTML before MathJax is loaded.\n*   **Conflicting requirements:** Conflicting math/text requirements can lead to font rendering issues in MathJax.\n\n**2. Integration with Markdown Processors and Frameworks:**\n\n*   **Markdown interference:** Markdown processors may alter special characters in LaTeX expressions (e.g., `$x_{i} + y_{i}$` rendered as `$x<em>{i} + y</em>{i}$`). Putting math content in a pair of backticks to protect it as `` may help, but MathJax does not parse LaTeX math in `` tags.\n*   **React Markdown:** When using MathJax with ReactMarkdown, MathJax may fail if the resulting DOM format is not in a regular representation with the MathJax delimiters preserved. A solution involves wrapping the Markdown component in a MathJax component.\n*   **Astro.js:** When using LaTeX in Astro.js, ensure the KaTeX CSS stylesheet link is correctly placed in the HTML head and is loading without issues. Also, ensure that your LaTeX is correctly formatted and that there are no syntax errors in your markdown files, as LaTeX syntax errors can break the parser and cause build failures.\n*   **Jekyll:** When using Jekyll, the code markdown line will be replaced by something else, so by the time that the MathJax script runs, the math block will be something completely different.\n\n**3. Font and CSS Styling:**\n\n*   **CSS styling issues:** LaTeX formulas might not render with the correct styles if the KaTeX CSS isn't loaded.\n    *   **Solution:** Confirm the KaTeX stylesheet link is correctly placed in the HTML head and is loading without issues. Check for network errors or restrictions that might prevent the CSS from loading.\n*   **Font rendering issues:** A font rendering issue may occur in MathJax.\n\n**4. MathJax Configuration and Loading:**\n\n*   **Asynchronous loading:** Load MathJax asynchronously to prevent it from blocking page rendering.\n*   **CDN configuration:** Use a MathJax CDN.\n*   **MathJax version:** An update to MathJax v3 may break LaTeX rendering. Adding a specific snippet to `_includes/script.html` may resolve the issue.\n*   **Loading necessary components:** MathJax may fail to load necessary components (like fonts).\n\n**5. Conflicts with Right-to-Left (RTL) Text:**\n\n*   **RTL conflicts:** When Hebrew (an RTL language) is present, the overall text direction of the page section might be set to RTL. This can interfere with the rendering of LTR mathematical formulas, causing them to display incorrectly or not at all.\n\n**6. Other Issues:**\n\n*   **Label errors:** When the math is re-typeset, the label already exists (from the first typesetting), and so the TeX input jax reports that as an error.\n*   **Network restrictions:** Unable to access the sites for MathJax through a company’s network.\n\nIt may be helpful to check the browser's console for error messages that can indicate JavaScript problems with the math rendering library (MathJax/KaTeX).\n"

Keep in mind that in CommonMark double backslash ( \\\\ ) has to be used, in order to describe a single backslash.\n\n**GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)**\n\n*   **Extension of CommonMark:** GFM builds upon CommonMark, adding additional features and syntax.\n*   **Native LaTeX Support:** GitHub supports LaTeX formatted math within Markdown.\n*   **MathJax Rendering:** GFM utilizes MathJax to render LaTeX expressions.\n*   **Delimiters:** GFM uses `$` as a delimiter for inline math expressions and `$$` for block math expressions.\n*   **Availability:** LaTeX rendering is available in GitHub Issues, Discussions, pull requests, wikis, and Markdown files.\n\n**Impact on LaTeX Equation Integration**\n\n*   **CommonMark:**  Since CommonMark doesn't have built-in LaTeX support, integrating equations requires extensions and careful handling of delimiters to avoid conflicts with Markdown syntax.\n*   **GFM:** GFM's native LaTeX support simplifies the integration of equations, as it directly renders LaTeX syntax using MathJax. This reduces the need for workarounds or external extensions.\n\nIn summary, GFM offers a more straightforward approach to integrating LaTeX equations due to its native support and MathJax rendering. CommonMark, on the other hand, requires extensions and careful configuration to achieve similar results.\n"

KaTeX focuses on speed and simplicity. It is designed to render mathematical notation quickly.\n*   **MathJax may be slower** because it loads code dynamically and has more features. However, MathJax version 3 has significantly improved in speed compared to version 2, making it more comparable to KaTeX.\n*   Server-side rendering can eliminate the speed differences between MathJax and KaTeX for the reader.\n\n**Rendering Quality & Features:**\n\n*   **MathJax supports a wider array of LaTeX commands** and can process various mathematical markup languages like MathML and AsciiMath. It aims to provide comprehensive support for LaTeX.\n*   **KaTeX supports a subset of LaTeX syntax**. It may lack support for some environments and commands. There are around 100 LaTeX functions listed as \"Not supported\" in the KaTeX documentation.\n*   **MathJax offers MathML output**, which is essential for accessibility as it is readable by screen readers.

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct Google Searches to gather the most recent information on \"robin feather characteristics\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nAmerican Robin feather characteristics include variations in color, size, and shape depending on the bird's age, sex, and feather type.\n\n**Coloration:**\n\n*   **Adults:** American Robins typically have dark gray or brown back and wing feathers. The breast feathers are reddish-orange, with males exhibiting darker and brighter coloration than females. The head and tail feathers of the male are black, while the corresponding feathers on the female are lighter. The throat is streaked blackish and whitish, more pronounced in males.\n*   **Juveniles:** Young robins have spotted breast feathers with an orange-red wash. They lack the characteristic red breast of adults and are speckly brown overall.\n*   **Color Pigments:** The colors of feathers are determined by pigments, with melanins creating brown, black, and gray, and carotenoids resulting in bright red and yellow feathers. Structural coloration, a trick of light, produces blue and white feathers.\n*   **Subspecies Variations:** The subspecies *T. m. confinis* found in southern Baja California, is the palest, with uniform pale gray-brown on the head, face, and upperparts, and pale buffy orange underparts.\n\n**Feather Types and Characteristics:**\n\n*   **Wing Feathers:** Secondary wing feathers are roughly 6cm in size and grayish-brown. They have a rounded tip and broad, almost evenly split surface. Hatch-year robins have a white leading edge on their secondary feathers, while adult birds have a darker coloration without spottiness. Outer secondaries are more curved and asymmetrical, making them stronger and more streamlined.\n*   **Tail Feathers:** Tail feathers are approximately 10cm long, dark in color, and have a white tip. Songbird tail feathers have a long, straight shaft.\n*   **Flight Feathers:** The longest feathers are the flight feathers, with primaries near the wing tip helping the bird move forward and secondaries closer to the body providing lift. Coverts, medium-sized feathers, overlap the flight feathers to ensure smooth airflow and protect the wing and tail feathers. The narrow side of the feather is the leading edge, which is stiff and strong, while the wide trailing edge provides more surface area to hold the bird up. Front feathers have more pointed tips to slice through the air, while back feathers have broader tips for greater surface area.\n\n**Molting:**\n\n*   Robins undergo a full moult at the end of the breeding season, typically between July and September, replacing worn-out feathers. Adult robins start molting their flight feathers in mid-June and finish by early September, while body feathers are molted from late July into October.\n*   Juvenile robins experience a partial moult in late summer, replacing their spotted plumage with the orange breast and brown back feathers of adulthood, though their wing feathers remain unchanged until the following year.\n*   During molting, birds may appear scruffy with missing feathers or visible pins (new feathers growing in). The process requires a lot of energy, and birds may become more secretive and less vocal to avoid predators.\n*   Fresh feathers have pale tips that can make them appear faded, but these tips wear away by spring.\n*   Molting ensures that robins have fresh feathers for insulation and flight, especially before migration.\n"

TextGrad uses backpropagation and text-based feedback to evaluate and improve prompts.\n*   **Meta-Prompting (e.g., Optimization by Prompting - OPRO):**  LLMs optimize prompts by considering previous prompts and their training accuracy, along with task descriptions and examples.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL allows AI models to experiment, evaluate, and refine prompts on their own using a reward-based system.\n*   **Automated Prompt Testing Tools:** Tools like Helicone, OpenAI Eval, Promptfoo, and LangChain are used for automated prompt testing.\n*   **Feedback-Driven Self-Evolving Prompts:** AI systems iteratively adjust responses based on user feedback, detecting inconsistencies and rewriting prompts to refine future outputs.\n*   **Evolutionary Algorithms:** These algorithms generate candidate prompts, making them more general.\n\n**2. How Automated Optimization Outperforms Manual Prompt Crafting:**\n\n*   **Scalability:** Manual prompt crafting doesn't scale well. Automated approaches are more practical for large-scale AI applications.\n*   **Efficiency:** Automated prompt optimization saves time and resources by eliminating manual trial-and-error.\n*   **Reduced Human Bias:** Automated systems minimize human error and bias, helping to identify optimal configurations.\n*   **Systematic Testing:** Automated systems allow for A/B testing, automated evaluation, and continuous optimization.\n*   **Finding Missed Optimizations:** Automated systems generate and test hundreds of variations, finding optimizations that humans might miss.\n*   **Improved Performance:** Studies show that organizations with systematic prompt engineering processes see 20-30% better performance than those relying on ad-hoc optimization. Research indicates AI can outperform human-generated prompts by up to 50% in specific tasks.\n\n**3. Metrics for Measuring Outperformance:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** Measures how correct the AI's responses are compared to a known correct output. Metrics like F1, BLEU, and ROUGE are used.\n*   **Relevance:** Assesses how well the generated text addresses the prompt.\n*   **Consistency:** Measures the variation in output quality across similar prompts and contexts.\n*   **Efficiency:** Measures how quickly and effectively the AI generates outputs.\n*   **Context Match Score (CMS):** Evaluates how well a prompt aligns with its intended purpose and generates contextually accurate responses.\n*   **Meaning Similarity Score (MSS):** Measures how well a prompt retains its semantic intent and deeper meaning across interactions.\n*   **Input-Output Match Score (IOMS):** Evaluates how well inputs align with outputs in LLM responses.\n*   **Context Fit Rate (CFR):** Ensures prompts address specific use cases while staying within contextual boundaries.\n*   **Prompt Complexity Index (PCI):** Balances clarity and detail in prompts to avoid overloading the model.\n*   **User Satisfaction Score:** Measures user satisfaction with the AI's responses.\n*   **Response Latency:** Measures the time it takes for the AI to generate a response.\n*   **Response Rate:** Measures the percentage of users who interact with prompts.\n*   **Conversion Rate:** Tracks how many users take the desired action after interacting with prompts.\n*   **Computational Cost:** Measures the resources required to generate outputs.\n*   **Error Rate:** Frequency of inappropriate, inaccurate, or irrelevant AI responses.\n\n**4. Key Considerations for Effective Prompt Optimization:**\n\n*   **Clarity and Specificity:** Using clear and specific language is crucial for effective prompt engineering.\n*   **Detailed Instructions:** Breaking tasks into smaller steps and tailoring instructions to the specific use case is important.\n*   **Context Provision:** Providing relevant background information helps the model understand the broader situation and produce more contextually appropriate responses.\n*   **Output Format Specifications:** Explicitly defining how you want information structured ensures consistency and usability.\n*   **Iterative Refinement:** Treat prompt creation as an iterative process, analyzing the output and refining the prompt to address shortcomings.\n*   **Systematic Evaluation:** Implement systematic measurement and optimization processes.\n*   **Understanding Model Capabilities:**  Consider the model's capabilities, task requirements, and potential edge cases when designing prompts.\n*    **Context Engineering:** Focus on optimizing the entire context window with the right information, not just the instruction text.\n\n**5. Tools & Resources:**\n\n*   **OpenAI Playground:** Test and refine prompts with real-time feedback.\n*   **PromptBase:** Marketplace for buying, selling, and discovering optimized prompts.\n*   **PromptChainer:** Build workflows by connecting multiple prompts.\n*   **Helicone:** Track, analyze, and optimize AI prompt performance.\n*   **Agenta:** Collaborate, test, and improve prompts as a team.\n*   **Orq.ai:** Enables seamless collaboration and real-time prompt refinement.\n*   **Arize Phoenix:** Track and compare different strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, automated prompt optimization techniques and tools are significantly outperforming manual prompt crafting in July 2025. This is due to their ability to scale, improve efficiency, reduce bias, and systematically test numerous prompt variations. Key metrics for measuring this outperformance include accuracy, relevance, consistency, efficiency, and user satisfaction. By leveraging these techniques and tools, organizations can unlock the full potential of AI and achieve better results with less effort.\n"

          "output": "To optimize battery life and performance on the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 with AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 and Radeon 880M graphics running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Gnome, consider the following power management configurations and tools:\n\n**1. Power Profiles Daemon:**\n\n*   Ubuntu 24.04 includes a new version of the Power Profiles Daemon that improves power efficiency, especially for modern AMD devices.\n*   This daemon provides \"Power Mode\" options in the Quick Settings menu: \"balanced\" (default), \"power saver\", and \"performance\" (if supported by drivers).\n*   The \"balanced\" profile is now mapped to a `balance_power` Energy Performance Preference (EPP) profile when on battery, instead of `balance_performance`. When connected to a power cable, it switches to the `balance_performance` profile. This effectively gives Ubuntu four power modes, though only three are exposed in the GUI.\n*   For Intel CPUs, the `energy_perf_bias` is increased to 8 (from 6), which may lead to better power savings.\n\n**2. ACPI Platform Profile:**\n\n*   The ACPI Platform Profile can significantly impact performance and power usage.\n*   Switching to the \"low-power\" profile can substantially reduce CPU power consumption, potentially to around 66% of the default.\n*   However, note that using the \"low-power\" profile may reduce performance.  Testing showed performance at 64% of the original out-of-the-box performance.\n*   The default \"balanced\" profile typically operates the Ryzen AI 7 360 in the 15-18 Watt range.\n\n**3. Power Management Tools:**\n\n*   **TLP:** TLP is a tool that can save power and prevent overheating by managing power for CPU, GPU, WiFi, Bluetooth, and HDD. To install TLP, use the following commands:\n    ```\n    sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw\n    sudo tlp start\n    ```\n    Then, reboot the system. TLP runs as a service and starts automatically on each reboot.\n*   **Laptop Mode Tools:** This package includes userland scripts needed to enable the Linux kernel's laptop mode, which allows the hard drive to spin down for longer periods, saving power. It supports automatically enabling laptop mode when the computer is on battery. To install, use the following command:\n    ```\n    sudo apt install laptop-mode-tools\n    ```\n\n**4. Gnome Extensions:**\n\n*   **Power Profile Switcher:** This extension automates switching between power modes (Performance, Balanced, and Power Saver) when plugging or unplugging the power supply. It also allows setting a low battery level percentage to automatically switch to power-saving mode. To install it, first install Extension Manager from the Ubuntu Software app:\n    ```\n    sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager\n    ```\n    Then, use Extension Manager to search for and install the \"Power Profile Switcher\" extension.\n\n**5. Manual Configuration:**\n\n*   **Screen Brightness:** Lowering screen brightness can significantly extend battery life.\n*   **Refresh Rate:** Reducing the screen refresh rate (e.g., from 165 Hz to 60 Hz) can also improve battery life. Use `cvt` and `xrandr` to create a custom refresh rate.\n*   **Disable Unused Wireless Technologies:** Turn off Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and mobile broadband when not in use.\n*   **Automatic Suspend:** Configure the computer to suspend automatically after a period of inactivity.\n\n**6. AMD Radeon 880M Graphics Optimization:**\n\n*   Ensure you are using a modern Linux distribution like Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with a Hardware Enablement (HWE) stack or newer to have good support for the Radeon 880M graphics.\n*   Keep the kernel updated for the best features, support, and performance, especially for RDNA 3.5 graphics and s2idle/resume quirks.\n*   Some tests have indicated that AMD's drivers for Linux are more efficient or mature than those available for Windows, resulting in better GPU performance in some cases.\n\n**7. Lenovo ThinkPad Specifics:**\n\n*   The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 offers Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as a pre-load option, indicating good Linux support.\n*   Consider using the \"Intelligent Cooling\" feature, and explore available power modes.\n*   Ensure \"Always On USB\" and \"Charge in Battery Mode\" are enabled in the UEFI BIOS if you intend to charge other devices from the laptop's USB ports while it is running on battery.\n\n**8. General Tips:**\n\n*   Keep your system updated. Windows 11's update ecosystem allows quicker deployment of performance improvements and driver fixes.\n*   Be aware of the potential for abnormal results in specific benchmarks. For example, Windows 11 may outperform Linux in LZ4 compression tests.\n*   Note that battery life estimations can vary and may differ from those seen on other operating systems.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Some users have reported occasional freezes with Ubuntu 25.04 when disabling WiFi or closing the lid, so testing on your specific hardware configuration is recommended.\n*   While the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 is certified for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, compatibility with newer versions like 24.10 and 25.04 is not guaranteed.\n*   Individual results may vary depending on the specific hardware configuration, software versions, and workloads.\n"

The strike is a solidarity action with other Republic Services workers across the nation who are also striking. The key demands of the striking workers include:\n\n*   **Better Wages:** Workers are seeking \"living wages\" that allow them to afford to live in the expensive areas they serve, such as San Francisco and Boston. They are asking for substantial pay increases.\n*   **Decent Benefits:** The workers are asking for better benefits, specifically affordable health insurance and retirement security.\n*   **Fair Labor Contracts:** The Teamsters accuse Republic Services of not bargaining in good faith and not settling fair labor contracts.\n*   **Safer Working Conditions:** Sanitation work is considered one of the deadliest jobs in the country, and workers are demanding safer working conditions.\n*   **Comparable Wages and Benefits:** Republic Services trash haulers are seeking wages and benefits comparable to competitors like Capitol Waste and Star Waste Systems.\n\nTeamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien stated that Republic Services is unwilling to offer workers good wages, decent benefits, or a fair contract. He also accused the company of burning massive profits and funneling money to \"undeserving, corrupt executives\". The union has warned that the strike could spread and shut down garbage collection in state after state if their demands are not met.\n"

          "output": "Michel Foucault's concept of governmentality, developed primarily between 1977 and 1984, combines \"government\" and \"rationality\" to describe how states govern populations and how individuals govern themselves. \"Government\" refers to activities that shape or guide people's conduct, including self-governance. Foucault introduced the concept in his 1977-78 lecture series at the Collège de France.\n\nKey aspects of Foucault's governmentality include:\n\n*   **Power and Conduct:** Governmentality emphasizes governing people's conduct through positive means rather than relying on sovereign power to enforce laws. It suggests power is not just wielded by institutions but is a pervasive feature of society, mediated and negotiated to create a perceived truth.\n*   **Beyond the State:** Governmentality expands the definition of government beyond the state's exercise of political power to include individuals' willingness to participate in their own governance. It posits that the state is not the only form of governing.\n*   **Rationality and Knowledge:** Rationality, in this context, involves systematic thinking to define and manage populations. The state uses systems to define populations, making them visible through management, administration, and classification.\n*   **Technologies and Practices:** Governmentality focuses on the rationalities, practices, and technologies of government, with freedom being central to contemporary governing strategies. Individuals are expected to be free, responsible, and accountable.\n*   **Neoliberalism:** Foucault's analysis extends to neoliberalism, where governance is characterized by market-driven principles that prioritize individual economic agency but may foster social inequality.\n*   **Target Population:** Governmentality is a form of power that targets the population, using political economy as its principal form of knowledge and security apparatuses as its essential technical means.\n*   **Normalization:** Governmentality operates through normalization, where individuals conform to dominant norms.\n*   **Evolution of Governance:** It explores the evolution and mechanisms of control within societies, transitioning from traditional authority to modern administrative states.\n"

          "output": "Foucault's concept of governmentality provides a framework for analyzing how power operates in society, extending beyond traditional notions of state control to encompass the ways in which individuals and populations are governed through various techniques and rationalities. It examines the \"conduct of conduct,\" or how behavior is shaped and directed through organized practices, mentalities, and techniques. This includes not only the actions of the state but also the ways individuals govern themselves. Foucault's work explores the evolution of governance from sovereign power to disciplinary power and, finally, to governmentality, which focuses on managing populations and fostering their well-being.\n\n**Historical Examples and Governmentality:**\n\n1.  **Management of Epidemics:** Foucault examined how responses to epidemics, such as leprosy, plague, and smallpox, have shaped governmental techniques.\n\n    *   **Leprosy:** The response to leprosy involved exclusion and confinement, serving as a model for later social exclusion practices. This represents sovereign power, characterized by coercive and repressive measures.\n    *   **Plague:** The plague led to disciplinary projects involving strict control of movement and confinement of individuals to their homes. This illustrates disciplinary power, which focuses on regulating and ordering people within a territory.\n    *   **Smallpox:** The management of smallpox through inoculation and vaccination exemplifies biopower, a governmental technique grounded in security and statistical normalization. This approach focuses on managing the population's health and well-being through measures such as vaccination, which relies on risk calculation and statistical estimates rather than solely on medical evidence.\n    *   **COVID-19:** The COVID-19 pandemic has also been analyzed through the lens of governmentality, with responses drawing on elements of sovereign power (e.g., special presidential powers), disciplinary power (e.g., lockdowns), and biopower (e.g., vaccination campaigns). Some analyses suggest that the pandemic has led to a \"securitization\" of health, with an emphasis on control and security measures.\n\n2.  **Development of Social Welfare Programs:** Foucault's concept of governmentality is also relevant to understanding the development of social welfare programs.\n\n    *   **Welfare State:** The rise of the welfare state in the late 19th and early 20th centuries represents a new formula for exercising rule, where expertise is linked to the formal political apparatus. Social welfare programs can be seen as governmental technologies that aim to foster and optimize the capacities and relations between people as resources.\n    *   **Neoliberalism:** Contemporary social welfare is challenged by neoliberal governmentality, which posits that states should limit their interventions and govern indirectly through autonomous actors. Neoliberal governance structures seek to minimize taxation and government regulation, resist mass-scale attempts to organize labor, and cast inequality as the inherent and necessary outcome of meritocratic social organization.\n    *   **Social Work:** Social work practices can be analyzed as techniques of governmentality, involving disciplinary power and the creation of self-governing individuals. Social workers act as \"modern pastors,\" using techniques such as counseling and expertise to gather information about the population and promote self-governance.\n\nIn summary, Foucault's concept of governmentality provides a valuable framework for understanding how power operates in various historical and contemporary contexts, including the management of epidemics and the development of social welfare programs. By analyzing the rationalities, techniques, and practices of governance, it is possible to gain insights into the ways in which individuals and populations are shaped and directed.\n"

Overdrive simulates the natural distortion of a tube amp, while distortion provides a more intense, harder clipping.\n*   **Transistors:** Fuzz pedals use transistors to achieve their sound. Germanium transistors were used in early fuzz pedals, while silicon transistors are more common now due to cost savings and consistency. Silicon transistors are known for a more \"modern\" voice. Some pedals use a hybrid of both.\n\n**Non-US Made Fuzz Pedals**\n\nIt's important to note that some fuzz pedals are inspired by classic circuits like the Fuzz Face or Big Muff Pi, and builders may incorporate elements from both germanium and silicon transistors to achieve unique tones.\n\n*   **Fjord Fuzz (Norway):** Fjord Fuzz is a Norwegian pedal company.

For example, the rusting of iron involves the oxidation of iron to form iron oxide (Fe2O3).\n*   **Acid-Base Reactions Forming Salts:** Acids react with metal oxides or metal hydroxides to form a salt and water.\n    *   Example: 2HCl (aq) + Na2O (aq) → H2O (l) + 2NaCl (aq)\n*   **Oxo Anions and Acids:** Some elements can be oxidized to form oxo anions or oxo acids. The synthesis of a salt of an oxo anion with a highly oxidized central atom is typically carried out in a basic solution. Strong oxidizing acids like nitric acid may be used as the oxidizing agent.\n\n**Metal and Acid Reactions**\n\nReactions between metals and acids are redox reactions where the metal is oxidized, and hydrogen ions are reduced to form hydrogen gas and a salt.\n\n*   General equation: Metal + Acid → Salt + Hydrogen\n*   Example: Ca(s) + H2SO4(aq) → CaSO4(aq) + H2(g)\n\n**Everyday Examples of Redox Reactions**\n\n*   **Rusting of Iron:** Iron reacts with oxygen and water to form iron oxide (rust).\n*   **Combustion:** Burning fuels like wood or gas involves redox reactions.\n*   **Batteries:** Electrochemical cells use redox reactions to convert chemical energy into electrical energy.\n*   **Digestion:** The breakdown of food involves numerous redox reactions.\n"

The oxidizing agent (or oxidant) gains electrons and is reduced, while the reducing agent (or reductant) loses electrons and is oxidized.\n\n**Identifying Oxidizing and Reducing Agents**\n\n*   **Oxidation States:** Assign oxidation states to all atoms in the reactants and products. Determine which atoms are oxidized (increase in oxidation state) and which are reduced (decrease in oxidation state). The oxidizing agent is the substance that is reduced, and the reducing agent is the substance that is oxidized.\n*   **Electron Transfer:** Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons. The substance that loses electrons is the reducing agent, and the substance that gains electrons is the oxidizing agent.\n\n**Factors Affecting Redox Reactions**\n\nSeveral factors can influence the rate and extent of redox reactions:\n\n*   **Strength of Agents:** The strength of the oxidizing and reducing agents plays a crucial role. Strong oxidizing agents have a high affinity for electrons, while strong reducing agents have a low ionization energy and electronegativity. The standard reduction potentials can be used to rank substances according to their oxidizing and reducing power.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** Temperature, solvent, and pH can affect redox reactions. Adjusting these parameters can lead to more effective utilization of the agents based on environmental suitability.\n*   **Other Factors:** Concentration, surface area, and the presence of catalysts can also influence the rate of redox reactions.\n\n**Strong Oxidizing and Reducing Agents**\n\n*   **Strong Oxidizing Agents:** Examples include fluorine (F2), oxygen, chlorine, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), chromium trioxide (CrO3) and nitric acid (HNO3). Fluorine is the strongest common oxidizing agent due to its high electronegativity.\n*   **Strong Reducing Agents:** Examples include lithium, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, zinc, iron, and metal hydrides (e.g., NaH, CaH2, LiAlH4). Lithium metal is the strongest reductant (most easily oxidized) of the alkali metals in aqueous solution.\n\n**Key Considerations**\n\n*   Some substances can act as both oxidizing and reducing agents, depending on the reaction conditions and what they are reacting with.\n*   The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) dictates whether a reaction is spontaneous. Favorable thermodynamic conditions often steer chemists toward choosing strong oxidizers or reducers capable of driving reactions efficiently.\n*   The compatibility of oxidizing and reducing agents with other reactants must be assessed, as certain agents may have reactive side reactions.\n"

While it's difficult to find a single reaction that neatly fits this specific combination, here's a breakdown of related concepts and examples that come close, based on the search results:\n\n**1. Disproportionation Reactions**\n\n*   **Definition:** A disproportionation reaction (or dismutation) is a redox reaction where a single species is both oxidized and reduced. This means an element in one oxidation state is converted into two different oxidation states.\n*   **Example:**  Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reacting with water.\n\n    *   3NO2 + H2O → 2HNO3 + NO\n    *   In this reaction, nitrogen in NO2 has an oxidation state of +4. It is reduced to +2 in NO and oxidized to +5 in HNO3. Nitric acid (HNO3) is the acid formed. While NO isn't a typical \"oxide,\" it is an oxide of nitrogen. This reaction doesn't produce a salt.\n*   **Another variant:** Thermal degradation of bicarbonate\n\n    *   2HCO−3 → CO2−3 + H2CO3\n    *   This is an acid-base reaction where oxidation numbers remain constant.\n\n**2. Reactions Forming Oxides, Salts, and Acids Separately**\n\n*   **Oxide Formation:** Many metals react with oxygen to form metal oxides.\n*   **Salt Formation:** Metal oxides react with acids to form salts and water.\n    *   Example: M2O + 2HCl → 2MCl + H2O (where M = Group 1 metal)\n*   **Acid Formation:** Nonmetal oxides react with water to form acids.\n    *   Example: N2O5 + H2O → 2HNO3\n\n**3. Redox Reaction Basics**\n\n*   **Oxidation and Reduction:** Oxidation is the loss of electrons, resulting in an increase in oxidation number. Reduction is the gain of electrons, resulting in a decrease in oxidation number.\n*   **Balancing Redox Reactions:** Redox reactions can be balanced using the half-reaction method, which involves separating the overall equation into oxidation and reduction half-reactions.\n\n**4. Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Oxidation Number:** A number assigned to an element in a chemical compound that represents the number of electrons lost or gained by an atom of that element in the compound.\n*   **Activity Series:** A list of metals arranged in order of decreasing ease of oxidation. This series can predict whether a metal will be oxidized by an acid or a metal salt solution.\n*   **Identifying Redox Reactions:** Look for changes in oxidation numbers. If an element's oxidation number changes during a reaction, it's a redox reaction.\n\n**In summary:** While a single reaction producing an oxide, salt, *and* acid simultaneously is elusive based on the search results, disproportionation reactions come closest. Also, keep in mind the separate reactions that form oxides, salts, and acids individually, as these are fundamental to understanding redox chemistry.\n"

The oxidation number of oxygen in H2O2 is -1, which lies between O2 (0) and H2O (-2), allowing it to be either reduced or oxidized.\n*   **Water (H2O):** Water can act as an oxidizing agent, such as when it is oxidized to oxygen by fluorine. Water can also act as a reducing agent, such as when it is reduced to hydrogen gas by lithium.\n*   **Nitrous Acid (HNO2):**\n*   **Sulfur Dioxide (SO2):**\n*   **Sulfurous Acid (H2SO3):**\n*   **Sodium Nitrite (NaNO2):**\n*   **Ozone (O3):**\n*   **Sodium Sulfite (Na2SO3):**\n*   **Transition Metals:** Transition metals can have multiple oxidation states, allowing them to be either reduced or oxidized. For example, Fe2+ can be oxidized to Fe3+ or reduced to Fe.\n\n**Factors Determining Oxidizing or Reducing Behavior:**\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** pH, temperature, and concentration can significantly affect the behavior of oxidizing and reducing agents.\n*   **Other Substances Present:** The ability of a substance to act as an oxidizing or reducing agent depends on the substance it is reacting with.\n*   **Standard Reduction Potential (E°):** The standard reduction potential serves as a quantitative measure of a substance's tendency to gain electrons, thus acting as an oxidizing or reducing agent. A higher E° indicates a stronger tendency to gain electrons and act as an oxidizing agent, while a lower E° indicates a stronger tendency to lose electrons and act as a reducing agent.\n*   **Oxidation State:** Any element in a compound whose oxidation state lies between its maximum and minimum oxidation state can behave as both an oxidizing and reducing agent.\n*   **Electronegativity:** The best reducing agents are located at the bottom left of the periodic table (low electronegativity), and the best oxidizing agents are located at the top right of the periodic table (high electronegativity, excluding noble gases).\n*   **Electron Affinity:** If a substance can gain electrons easily, it should have high electron affinity (ability to gain electrons) and act as an oxidizing agent.\n"

Enable Faststart and Asynchronous Saving:**\n\n   *   Enable the `faststart` property in `mp4mux` to move the 'moov' atom to the beginning of the file [fanyamin](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [manpagez](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [stackoverflow](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n   *   Use the `splitmuxsink` element to split the output into multiple files based on duration or size [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [freedesktop](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3). This ensures that you have smaller, playable chunks of the recording.\n   *   Set `async-finalize=true` in `splitmuxsink` to finalize the old muxer and sink asynchronously [fanyamin](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4) [freedesktop](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3).\n\nHere's the modified pipeline:\n\n```bash\ngst-launch-1.0 -e \\\naravissrc features=\"OverlapMode=On Width=1024 Height=1024 ExposureAuto=Continuous AcquisitionFrameRate=88.5 AcquisitionFrameRateEnable=1 GevSCPSPacketSize=8164 Gain=0 GainAuto=Continuous GammaEnable=1 GammaSelector=sRGB\" ! video/x-bayer,width=1024,height=1024 ! \\\ntcamconvert ! \\\nnvvidconv compute-hw=1 ! \"video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),format=NV12,width=640,height=640\" ! \\\ntee name=t t. ! \\\n    queue ! m.sink_0 nvstreammux name=m batch-size=1 width=640 height=640 live-source=1 ! \\\n    nvinfer config-file-path=config_infer_primary_yoloV8.txt ! \\\n    nvdsosd ! nvegltransform ! fpsdisplaysink text-overlay=false video-sink=nveglglessink \\\nt. ! queue ! nvvidconv compute-hw=1 ! \\\n    x264enc bitrate=6000 speed-preset=ultrafast tune=zerolatency key-int-max=30 ! \\\n    splitmuxsink location=output_%05d.mp4 muxer-factory=mp4mux muxer-properties=\"properties,faststart=true\" max-size-time=10000000000 async-finalize=true\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n*   `splitmuxsink` splits the output into multiple files (e.g., `output_00000.mp4`, `output_00001.mp4`, etc.) [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [freedesktop](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3).\n*   `muxer-factory=mp4mux` specifies that `mp4mux` should be used for creating the MP4 files [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n*   `muxer-properties=\"properties,faststart=true\"` sets the `faststart` property of `mp4mux` to true, placing the 'moov' atom at the beginning of each file [fanyamin](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [manpagez](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [stackoverflow](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n*   `max-size-time=10000000000` sets the maximum duration of each file to 10 seconds (10,000,000,000 nanoseconds) [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [freedesktop](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3).

Using `moov-recovery-file` (Experimental):**\n\n   *   As an alternative, you could try using the `moov-recovery-file` property of `mp4mux`, although it's marked as experimental [manpagez](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0) [stackoverflow](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-1) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-2).

Consider Fragmented MP4 (fMP4) Muxers:**\n\n   *   For streaming, consider using dedicated fragmented MP4 muxers like `cmafmux`, `dashfmp4mux`, or `isofmp4mux` [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). These muxers are designed for creating fragmented MP4 files suitable for DASH and HLS streaming [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n\n**4.  Alternative Container Formats:**\n\n   *   If resilience to interruption is critical, consider using `matroskamux` to save to an MKV file [nvidia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-9).  MKV files can often be recovered even if the recording is interrupted [nvidia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-9).\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   Avoid using both `splitmuxsink` and `mp4mux` with `fragment-duration` simultaneously, as they can conflict [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n*   Ensure your encoder has a defined GOP size when using `splitmuxsink` so that new files start with a keyframe [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).  The `key-int-max` property in `x264enc` controls the keyframe interval [gstreamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n*   The `async` property in `filesink` is related to asynchronous state changes, not asynchronous writing of data [valadoc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [freedesktop](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).  `splitmuxsink` with `async-finalize=true` provides asynchronous file handling [fanyamin](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4) [freedesktop](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3).\n\nBy implementing these changes, you can ensure that your recordings are saved frequently and that the 'moov' atom is placed at the beginning of the file, increasing the likelihood of successful playback even if the recording is interrupted. Remember to test these modifications thoroughly to ensure they meet your specific requirements.",

A typical MP4 file has its metadata (the 'moov' atom) located at the end of the file. However, for \"faststart\" files, the 'moov' atom is moved to the beginning of the file, which allows the file to be played while downloading.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how `mp4mux` and the 'moov' atom work in GStreamer:\n\n*   **Moov Atom Location:** By default, `mp4mux` writes the 'moov' atom at the end of the file after all the sample data has been written.\n*   **Faststart:** The \"faststart\" option rearranges the file structure to place the 'moov' atom near the beginning. This is useful for streaming because the player can read the metadata without having to download the entire file.\n*   **How Faststart Works:** Achieving a faststart file requires some extra processing. The `mp4mux` element needs to either reserve space at the beginning of the file for the 'moov' atom or rewrite the file after all data has been written.\n*   **Using Faststart:** You can enable the faststart option in `mp4mux` using the `faststart` property. In `gst-launch`, this looks like `mp4mux faststart=true`.\n*   **Tradeoffs:** Moving the 'moov' atom to the start might take slightly longer due to the extra processing. It could potentially double the disk I/O because the data might need to be read and rewritten.\n\n**Properties related to 'moov' atom and faststart:**\n\n*   **faststart-file:** This property specifies a file that will be used temporarily to store data from the stream when creating a faststart file. If set to NULL, a file path will be created automatically.\n*   **moov-recovery-file:**  This specifies a file to store data for the 'moov' atom, enabling movie file recovery in case of a crash during muxing. This is an experimental feature.\n*   **reserved-moov-update-period:** When used with `reserved-max-duration`, this property periodically updates the index tables with information muxed so far.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n*   GStreamer 1.26 includes MP4 muxer fixes for creating very large files with faststart support.\n*   The `streamable` property allows foregoing the addition of index metadata at the end of the file when a fragmented layout is intended for streaming.\n"

          "output": "Asynchronous saving with GStreamer's `filesink` element involves configuring the sink to handle state changes and data writing without blocking the pipeline. Here's a synthesis of information regarding asynchronous saving with `filesink` in GStreamer:\n\n**Key Aspects of Asynchronous Saving**\n\n*   **`filesink` Element:** The `filesink` element is used to write incoming data to a file in the local file system.\n*   **Asynchronous State Changes:** The `async` property, found in `GstBaseSink` (the base class for `filesink`), can be used to instruct the sink to never perform an ASYNC state change. This is useful when dealing with non-synchronized or sparse streams.\n*   **Buffering:**  `filesink` has properties like `buffer-mode` and `buffer-size` to control how data is buffered before writing to the file.\n*   **Synchronous I/O:** The `o-sync` property can be set to TRUE to open the file with `O_SYNC`, enabling synchronous I/O.\n\n**Practical Considerations and Implementation**\n\n*   **Saving Pipeline Output:** To save GStreamer pipeline output to a file, the `filesink` element should be used with a relevant video format. For example:\n\n    ```text\n    gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=detection.mp4 name=src_0 ! decodebin ! queue leaky=no max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 ! ... ! filesink location=video.mp4\n    ```\n*   **Stopping and Starting Save:** To reliably start/stop saving a stream to a file, one approach involves using `interpipesrc` and `interpipesink`.  When it's time to save a video clip, the filename is set on the `filesink` and the pipeline with the `interpipesrc` is set to PLAYING. Stopping the pipeline closes the file.\n*   **Keyframes and Black Video:** When saving H.264 streams, inserting a black screen may occur if the saving starts mid-stream without a keyframe. This is because H.264 relies on keyframes for decoding.\n*   **Multiple Sinks:** When using multiple sinks (e.g., `filesink` and `appsink`), ensure proper synchronization. A `queue` element before the `appsink` can help prevent deadlocks by storing the first buffer.\n*   **Tee Element:** The `tee` element can be used to create multiple branches in a pipeline, allowing you to display a video stream and simultaneously write it to a file.\n*   **File Saving Order:** There is no way to control the saving order of files using public sink plugins. Most sinks work with a clock and try to consume data as soon as possible. To control the saving order, you might need to create a custom plugin for audio and video sinks or add a probe function with variables to control the file save order.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\n*   **Empty Files:** If the file is created but remains empty, ensure that the necessary encoders and muxers are included in the pipeline.\n*   **Pipeline Freezing:** If the GStreamer pipeline freezes when using `tee` with multiple sinks, it could be due to hardware incompatibilities, software bugs, configuration errors, or driver issues. Check the system logs for hardware error messages.\n*   **Unplayable Files:** If the recorded file is unplayable, verify the pipeline configuration.  For instance, if decoding H.264 and saving as a raw file, remove the decoder to save the H.264 stream directly.\n*   **Debugging:** Use environment variables like `GST_DEBUG=6` to set the debug level. Also, tools like `gst-discoverer-1.0` and `gst-inspect-1.0` can be used to discover video files and inspect plugins, respectively.\n\n**Important Properties**\n\n*   **`location`:**  Specifies the location of the file to write to.\n*   **`append`:**  If set to TRUE, the sink will append to an existing file.\n*   **`sync`:** When set to FALSE, can remove dropped frame rate, lag and error messages.\n"

Here's a breakdown of fragmented MP4s in GStreamer:\n\n**Fragmented MP4 Support and Usage**\n\n*   **`mp4mux` Functionality:** The built-in `mp4mux` in GStreamer can create fragmented MP4 files. You can set properties like `fragment-duration` to control the fragment size. Setting `streamable=true` avoids writing index metadata at the end of the file, which is useful for streaming.\n*   **Alternative Muxers:** GStreamer 1.22 introduced new MP4 muxers as part of the GStreamer Rust plugins, including a dedicated fragmented MP4 muxer. These are intended to replace the existing `qtmux` / `mp4mux` from `gst-plugins-good`. Examples of fragmented mp4 muxers are `cmafmux`, `dashfmp4mux`, `isofmp4mux`.\n*   **`fragmp4pay` element:** For specific applications like Pravega, the standard `mp4mux` output isn't well-suited because it writes important headers only at the beginning, making truncation and seeking difficult. Pravega offers a `fragmp4pay` element that duplicates necessary headers at every indexed position to solve this, which simplifies truncation and seeking.\n*   **Splitmuxsink:** The `splitmuxsink` element splits a stream into file parts based on maximum duration or file size, creating individually playable files. It is mostly used with muxers that don't support splitting natively, such as MP4 or Matroska.\n*   **Key Frame Considerations:** When using `splitmuxsink`, ensure the encoder has a GOP size defined so that new files start with a key frame.\n\n**Fragmented MP4 Structure**\n\n*   A fragmented MP4 file contains metadata at the start, with the rest of the data spread out into fragments.\n*   Each fragment typically contains a 'moof' (movie fragment) and an 'mdat' (media data) atom.\n\n**Use Cases**\n\n*   Fragmented MP4 is suitable for streaming.\n*   It's also recommended to store MP4 fragments in the payload of data stream events, which allows multiplexing of video and audio channels, provides a time source mechanism, and enables truncation and concatenation at any point.\n\n**Example Pipelines and Properties**\n\n*   To output multi-file fragmented MP4, properties like `splitmuxsink muxer='mp4mux faststart=true streamable=true fragment-duration=1000 trak-timescale=1000 movie-timescale=1000 presentation-time=true' max-size-time=1000000000 location=file%02d.mp4` can be set.\n*   A complete pipeline example using `splitmuxsink` is: `gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! videoconvert ! queue ! x264enc tune=zerolatency ! splitmuxsink location=video%02d.mp4 async-finalize=true max-size-time=10000000000 muxer-factory=mp4mux muxer-properties=\"properties,fragment-duration=2000\"`. Note that the `fragment-duration` property in `muxer-properties` might not work as expected with `splitmuxsink`.\n\n**Issues and Solutions**\n\n*   A reported issue involved missing header data in segments after the first one when using `mp4mux` and `multifilesink`.\n*   When rotating video, the `display_aspect_ratio` value might not be updated, causing stretching in some players.\n"

          "output": "The primary difference between `splitmuxsink` and using `mp4mux` with `fragment-duration` in GStreamer lies in their intended purpose and how they handle file splitting and fragmentation.\n\n**`mp4mux` with `fragment-duration`:**\n\n*   This approach utilizes the `mp4mux` element's built-in fragmentation capabilities.\n*   The `fragment-duration` property specifies the duration of each fragment in milliseconds. Setting `fragment-duration` to a value greater than 0 enables fragmented MP4 output.\n*   It creates a fragmented MP4 file (fMP4) suitable for streaming protocols like DASH and HLS.\n*   Metadata can be located at the start of the file using the `faststart` property, or spread out into fragments with the `fragment-duration` property.\n*   The `streamable` property, when set to true, prevents writing indexes or duration at the end of the file, which is useful for streaming.\n\n**`splitmuxsink`:**\n\n*   This element is designed to split a stream into multiple files based on maximum duration or file size.\n*   It wraps a muxer (by default `mp4mux`) and a sink, creating a new file when a size or time threshold is reached.\n*   `splitmuxsink` is primarily intended for muxers that don't natively support splitting, such as MP4 or Matroska.\n*   It splits the stream at video keyframe boundaries to ensure each file is individually playable. The minimum file size is one Group of Pictures (GOP).\n*   It can handle one video stream along with multiple audio and subtitle streams.\n*   In `async-finalize` mode, the old muxer and sink are disconnected and finalized asynchronously, while a new muxer and sink are created for the next fragment.\n\n**When to use each:**\n\n*   Use `mp4mux` with `fragment-duration` when you need to create fragmented MP4 files (fMP4) for streaming purposes like DASH or HLS. This method creates a single file with a fragmented structure.\n*   Use `splitmuxsink` when you need to split a stream into multiple, individually playable MP4 files based on size or duration. This is useful for recording applications where you want to limit the size of each file.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Using both `splitmuxsink` and `mp4mux` with `fragment-duration` simultaneously can lead to conflicts, as both elements will try to handle splitting.\n*   For creating fragmented MP4 files for DASH/HLS, consider using dedicated fragmented MP4 muxers like `cmafmux`, `dashfmp4mux`, or `isofmp4mux`. Note that `fmp4mux` needs GStreamer 1.18 or later.\n*   When using `splitmuxsink`, ensure the video stream contains closed GOPs for proper playback of individual file parts. You may need to set the `key-int-max` property of the encoder to control the keyframe interval.\n*   `splitmuxsink` can post messages like `\"splitmuxsink-fragment-opened\"` or `\"splitmuxsink-fragment-closed\"` when it opens or closes a new fragment, allowing you to trigger callbacks.\n*   For streaming, `matroskamux` or `mpegtsmux` might be better choices than `qtmux` or `mp4mux`, as the latter are more suitable for local file saving and require an EOS signal to complete a valid file.\n"

          "output": "The `moov-recovery-file` property in `mp4mux` (a GStreamer element for creating MP4 files) is designed to help recover corrupted or incomplete MP4 files resulting from crashes during muxing, such as those caused by a sudden power loss. Here's how it works and its limitations:\n\n**Functionality**\n\n1.  **Mechanism**: When the `moov-recovery-file` property is set, `mp4mux` stores data necessary for creating the 'moov' atom (the metadata header of an MP4 file) in a separate file. The 'moov' atom contains crucial information like track headers and sample tables. This metadata is usually written at the end of the file after all multimedia data has been recorded.\n\n2.  **Recovery**: If recording is interrupted, the main MP4 file might be unplayable because the 'moov' atom was not properly written. In such cases, the `qtmoovrecover` element (also part of GStreamer) can use the recovery file to reconstruct the 'moov' atom and repair the MP4 file. The `qtmoovrecover` element takes the broken input file, the recovery file, and an output file as parameters.\n\n3.  **Usage**: To use this feature, you need to set the `moov-recovery-file` property in your GStreamer pipeline when creating the MP4 file. If a crash occurs, you then need to use a separate pipeline with `qtmoovrecover` to repair the file.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n1.  **Experimental**: The `moov-recovery-file` property is marked as experimental.\n\n2.  **Separate Recovery Step**: Using `moov-recovery-file` requires a separate recovery step with the `qtmoovrecover` element, which involves creating a new GStreamer pipeline.\n\n3.  **Not Always Effective**: Even with the recovery file, complete recovery isn't guaranteed.\n\n4.  **Alternative Muxers**: In scenarios where sudden termination is possible, using `matroskamux` to save to an MKV file might be a better option, as it can preserve most of the recorded content even if the recording is interrupted.\n\n5.  **File Size Considerations:** The approximate recording duration must be known in advance to estimate how much free space to reserve for the 'moov' atom. Overestimating the amount of space to reserve can waste free space at the start of the file.\n\n**Alternatives and Workarounds**\n\n1.  **Faststart Files**:  Using the \"faststart\" option arranges the 'moov' atom to be located near the start of the file, allowing the file to be played while downloading.\n\n2.  **Reserved Properties**:  Instead of using `moov-recovery-file`, the `reserved-*` properties of `qtmux` can be used to periodically write the 'moov' atom, potentially making the file playable even if interrupted.\n\n3.  **Third-Party Repair Tools**: Several third-party tools and libraries can repair corrupted MP4 files, some of which can reconstruct the header. Some suggest using a reference video from the same camera to help with the repair. These tools include:\n\n    *   Clever Free Online Video Repair Tool\n    *   EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard\n    *   Digital Video Repair\n    *   Stellar Repair for Video\n    *   VLC media player (using the \"Always fix\" option for AVI files or re-encoding)\n    *   HandBrake (for re-encoding)\n    *   Disk Drill\n    *   Wondershare Repair It\n\n4.  **Manual Repair**: In some cases, it may be possible to manually repair the file using a hex editor, by copying the header/trailer from a similar, working MP4 file.\n\n5.  **Other Container Formats**: Consider using other container formats like AVI, FLV, or MKV, which may be more resilient to sudden interruptions.\n"

Some suppliers offer premium products, while others sell lower-quality items. It's often a \"hit or miss\" situation.\n*   **Supplier Reputation:** The quality of the supplier is often more important than the product itself. Look for reputable suppliers specializing in a specific niche.\n*   **Electronics:** Electronics can be frequently faulty or defective, especially computer accessories, hard drives, and batteries.\n*   **Knock-offs:** AliExpress does not sell name-brand products. If a deal seems too good to be true, it's likely a fake.\n*   **Shipping Issues:** Potential issues include shipping delays, and some vendors use poor packaging, which can result in damage.\n*   **Communication:** Communication challenges with sellers can occur.\n*   **Scams:** There have been reports of scams, so caution is advised.\n*   **Returns:** It is not always worth returning items unless they are expensive.\n\n**Tips for Safe Shopping on AliExpress:**\n\n*   **Research:** Research products and sellers before buying. Check seller ratings and reviews. Look for a high positive feedback percentage.\n*   **Tracking:** Only buy if there is tracking available.\n*   **Payment:** Use a payment method you trust.\n*   **Samples:** If you plan to dropship, order samples first.\n*   **Disputes:** If you're unsatisfied, contact AliExpress support to report the problem. If the seller is unhelpful, open a dispute.\n*   **Video:** For higher-priced items, consider recording yourself opening the package.\n\n**AliExpress Buyer Protection:**\n\n*   AliExpress offers buyer protection, providing refunds if the product doesn't arrive on time or isn't as described. You can request a refund if you have not received your parcel within the buyer protection period. You can also ask for a partial to full refund, replacement, or a voucher if something is broken, not good, or fake.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Shipping Times:** Shipping times can be long since most products ship from overseas.\n*   **Unrealistic Expectations:** Don't expect superior quality products.\n*   **\"Too Good to Be True\" Prices:** Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true. The item may be fake or of poor quality.\n"

They proudly refuse government aid, which, while admirable in its commitment to autonomy, also means their villages remain, shall we say, *rustic* [djilp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).

          "output": "The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) initiated a rebellion on January 1, 1994, to protest the treatment of indigenous people in Mexico, the implementation of NAFTA, and the privatization of indigenous lands. While the EZLN has achieved a degree of autonomy for indigenous communities and influenced national and international agendas regarding ethnic diversity, it has also faced criticisms and limitations.\n\n**Achievements:**\n\n*   **Indigenous Dignity:** The Zapatistas have significantly improved indigenous dignity in Chiapas, where, prior to the uprising, indigenous people were marginalized.\n*   **Autonomous Communities:** The EZLN has established 38 autonomous indigenous communities in Chiapas. These communities, called \"caracoles,\" operate independently from the local government.\n*   **Influence on National Agenda:** The EZLN has successfully brought the recognition of ethnic diversity to the forefront of the national agenda in Mexico.\n*   **Civil Resistance:** The EZLN shifted from armed struggle to civil resistance strategies, maintaining a ceasefire with the Mexican state since 1994.\n*   **Self-Governance:** The Zapatistas have demonstrated self-governance in the territories under their control, known as Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities (MAREZ). They have created spaces for people to think, discuss, and decide for themselves as peoples.\n\n**Limitations and Criticisms:**\n\n*   **Poverty:** Zapatista villages remain in poverty, partly due to their refusal of government aid.\n*   **Limited Impact on National Policies:** The EZLN has not been able to weaken the Mexican government's commitment to neo-liberal economic policies.\n*   **Territorial Control:** The EZLN's operations have largely been limited to parts of Chiapas, failing to transform all of Mexico as initially intended.\n*   **Military Weakness:** The EZLN's military capabilities were limited, and they were forced to retreat to the highlands during the Mexican Army's counteroffensive in 1994.\n*   **Loss of International Lustre:** The Zapatista movement has lost some of its international appeal, overshadowed by other alternative world dynamics and social forums.\n*   **Operational Failures:** The EZLN has acknowledged operational failures in their structure, leading to a separation between authorities and towns. The \"pyramid\" structure of governance was found to be ineffective, hindering the flow of information and collective decision-making.\n*   **Broadness of Movement:** The EZLN's attempt to appeal to a wide range of groups, including small businesses, workers, and peasants, has been identified as a weakness.\n*   **Critique from the Left:** Some critics argue that the EZLN's program is aligned with the defense of domestic capital rather than the interests of the proletariat.\n\n**Ironic aspects:**\n\n*   **Refusal of Government Aid:** The EZLN's refusal of government aid, while maintaining autonomy, has contributed to the poverty in Zapatista villages.\n*   **Limited Transformation:** Despite aiming to transform all of Mexico, the EZLN's operations have been limited to certain areas of Chiapas.\n*   **Evolution from Military to Civil Resistance:** The EZLN's shift from armed struggle to civil resistance highlights the limitations of their initial military approach.\n*   **Self-Criticism:** The EZLN's self-criticism regarding their governance structure and operational failures demonstrates a willingness to learn and adapt, even after decades of struggle.\n*   **The \"Other Campaign\":** The \"Other Campaign\" was criticized by some as left-capitalist constitutional reformism.\n"

These criticisms include:\n\n*   **Abuses During the 1995 Crackdown:** In February 1995, the Mexican government ordered a crackdown on alleged Zapatistas. During this operation, state officials detained over twenty alleged EZLN members and committed serious human rights violations, including torture, extracting confessions by force, and disregarding due-process guarantees. Human Rights Watch documented instances of physical and psychological torture, including near drowning and electric shocks. The governmental National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) found that the Office of the Attorney General tried to cover up the abuses, and government prosecutors failed to investigate the allegations of torture.\n*   **Due Process Violations:** Police and prosecutors violated due-process guarantees in cases such as the Benavides, Elorriaga, and Yanga cases. Witnesses who testified against the alleged Zapatistas or the legal defenders assigned to the detainees could not be located by officials after giving their initial statements, raising the possibility that government officials falsified evidence and deprived detainees of their right to an adequate defense. Arrest warrants were also faulty or missing in these cases.\n*   **Raids on Pro-EZLN Communities:** Pro-EZLN communities, known as autonomous municipalities, were raided by state and federal police, often with army backup. Authorities dismantled an autonomous municipality within Taniperla, called Ricardo Flores Magón, and detained sixteen Mexicans and twelve foreigners.\n*   **Violence and Displacement:** Zapatista communities have suffered attacks causing damage and displacement of local residents. In October 2024, the Zapatistas and human rights organizations warned that one of their support bases had been subjected to new threats and hostile actions by a neighboring community, with accusations that local authorities were endorsing these actions.\n*   **Paramilitary Violence:** Paramilitary violence against Zapatista communities has resurged. Civil society organizations have criticized the Mexican government for its lack of active engagement in conflict resolution and condemned governmental actions that have led various actors to perceive violence as a useful political tool.\n*   **Critiques of Autonomy:** Subcomandante Moisés stated that the prior form of autonomy \"proved that it will no longer be useful for what is to come\". There was a critique of how autonomy had become “pyramidal\". Besides cases of “poor administration of people&#39;s resources” (that were sanctioned), Subcomandante Moisés explains that the principal defect is that the authorities were “already falling into wanting to decide themselves, the authorities.\"\n*   **Justice System Issues:** Marcos complained that the state government's justice system has been slow and inefficient, even though it can act expeditiously when it comes to penalizing its political enemies. The Caracoles had made mistakes, including the place given to women, the relation between the Zapatistas' political-military structure and the autonomous governments, and the lack of courtesy shown to people who travel from afar to meet with the Caracoles.\n*   **Land Disputes and Aggression:** Aggressions against the BAEZLN have increased since 2019. The main form of aggression has been land invasion, armed attacks, and harassment against girls, boys, men, and women of this autonomous Zapatista community.\n*   **Accusations of Authoritarianism:** The Mexican government has accused the autonomous municipalities of being unconstitutional and illegal, organizing military and police operations against them.\n*   **EZLN's own self-criticism:** The EZLN points out that beyond the structure of the autonomous municipalities and the good governance boards, there were operational failures that led to “the pyramid separating the authorities from the towns.\" The proposals from the authorities no longer came down to the people and the opinions of the people fail to reach the authorities.\n"

          "output": "Based on the search results, here's what can be gathered regarding \"Crow Tribal Council resolutions 1973 name\":\n\n*   **Government Structure:** Prior to 2001, the Crow Tribe of Montana was governed by a 1948 constitution that organized the tribe as a general council (tribal council). This council held executive, legislative, and judicial powers and included all enrolled adult members (women 18+, men 21+). In 2001, a new constitution established a three-branch government.\n\n*   **Tribal Council/General Council:** Even after the 2001 changes, the general council technically remains the governing body. However, it hasn't convened since July 15, 2001. The Executive Branch officials also serve within the Crow Tribal General Council.\n\n*   **Resolution 74-05 (Likely Enacted in 1973, Implemented in 1974):** In 1973, the Crow Tribal Council passed Resolution 74-05, which prohibited hunting and fishing within the reservation by anyone who was not a member of the Crow Tribe. This resolution directed officials to enforce the ordinance and any federal statute prohibiting hunting, fishing, and trespassing, but it did not apply to members of the Crow Tribe. The resolution was later challenged, with a court case addressing the tribe's power to proscribe hunting and fishing by non-members on fee patent lands where those non-members resided.\n\n*   **Accessing Resolutions:** The Crow Tribe Legislative Branch website may contain links to current and historic Legislative Resolutions. Additionally, the Ann Big Man Collection at the Little Big Horn College Library contains Crow Tribal Council minutes and resolutions, including specific files for 1969-1972, 1973-1978, and selected resolutions from 1971-1974. The National Indian Law Library (NILL) also has resolutions available.\n\n*   **Other Relevant Information:**\n    *   In 1973, the Indian voting age was lowered to eighteen to conform with the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n    *   A report was presented to the Crow Tribe in 1973 detailing the effects of coal mining on the reservation.\n"

AD 100. He is considered a central figure in Neopythagoreanism and was renowned as a miracle worker.\n\n**Life and Historical Context:**\n\n*   Apollonius was born into a respected and wealthy aristocratic Greek family.\n*   His primary biographer, Philostratus, places his birth around 3 BC – AD 97, while historian Cassius Dio suggests a birth year around AD 40.\n*   He spent his life traveling and teaching in the Middle East, North Africa, and India.\n*   Apollonius adhered to Pythagorean principles, including vegetarianism, frugality, and the rejection of animal sacrifices.\n*   He entered the temple of Aesculapius during his teens and learned the art of healing.\n\n**Miracles and Legends:**\n\n*   Many legends surround Apollonius, with numerous reports of miracles performed as a wandering sage with his companion Damis.\n*   He was said to have performed miraculous cures, restored sight to the blind, cast out devils, enabled the lame to walk, and even reanimated the dead.\n*   Other accounts credit him with prophecy and remote viewing. One story claims he predicted Emperor Domitian's death in real-time from afar.\n*   Followers believed he underwent heavenly ascension after his conviction and death penalty for allegedly conspiring against the emperor through magic.\n*   Talismans made by Apollonius appeared in several cities of the Eastern Roman Empire in Late Antiquity.\n\n**Sources and Writings:**\n\n*   The most detailed source on his life is *Life of Apollonius of Tyana*, written by Philostratus in the 3rd century AD at the request of Empress Julia Domna.\n*   Philostratus claimed to have used the \"memoirs\" of Damis, Apollonius's acolyte and companion, as a source. Other sources include a book on Apollonius's youth by Maximus of Aegae and local knowledge from various cities.\n*   Philostratus's biography portrays Apollonius as a philosopher, miracle-worker, and defender of Pythagorean ideals. Some scholars believe the biography is more fiction than fact.\n*   Apollonius wrote books and treatises on science, medicine, and philosophy.\n\n**Comparisons with Jesus:**\n\n*   Philostratus's description of Apollonius's life and deeds contains similarities to the life and claimed miracles of Jesus.\n*   Some scholars suggest that Philostratus's biography was an attempt to create a pagan alternative to Jesus and compete with Christianity.\n\n**Impact and Legacy:**\n\n*   Apollonius's exceptional personality and mystical way of life impressed his contemporaries and had a lasting cultural influence.\n*   Emperor Aurelian spared Tyana from destruction after reportedly having a vision of Apollonius.\n*   In Islamic traditions, he was revered as \"Balinus\" and credited with discovering the Emerald Tablet and contributing to alchemical knowledge.\n\nIt is important to note that while most modern scholars agree that Apollonius existed historically, the miraculous accounts attributed to him are subject to debate. Some scholars believe that the oldest known record of Apollonius's miracles comes from Philostratus's book, written long after Apollonius lived, and may have borrowed details from the Gospel accounts of Jesus' miracles.\n"

          "output": "Apollonius of Tyana, known as \"Balinus\" in Islamic traditions, is a significant figure in the history of alchemy, largely due to his association with the Emerald Tablet. Here's a breakdown of his attributed alchemical knowledge and the Emerald Tablet's significance:\n\n**Apollonius of Tyana (Balinus) and Alchemy in Islamic Traditions:**\n\n*   **Master of Talismans:** Apollonius was revered as the \"Master of Talismans\" (Sahib at-tilasmat) in Arabic traditions.\n*   **Attribution of Alchemical Works:** Several Arabic alchemical works, for which no Greek originals exist, are attributed to Apollonius of Tyana. While most scholars consider these works pseudepigraphal, they reveal genuine currents of Graeco-Arabic Hermeticism.\n*   **Sirr al-Khaliqa (The Secret of Creation):** The most influential work associated with Balinus is the *Sirr al-Khaliqa wa-san'at al-tabi'a* (\"Secrets of Creation and the Art of Nature\"), also known as *Kitab al-'Ilal* (\"Book of Causes\"). This 9th-century book expounds on the origins of the cosmos and situates alchemy as a science of cosmogenesis. It significantly influenced the alchemical school of Jabir ibn-Hayyan.\n*   **Discovery of the Emerald Tablet:** The *Sirr al-Khaliqa* narrates the story of how Apollonius entered the crypt of Hermes Trismegistus and discovered the Emerald Tablet. In this narrative, Balinus finds an old man seated on a golden throne holding an emerald tablet, and in front of him was a book with the secrets of creation.\n*   **Philosophical and Alchemical Successor to Hermes Trismegistus:** Through this association with the Emerald Tablet, Apollonius becomes the philosophical and alchemical successor to Hermes Trismegistus.\n*   **Other Attributed Works:** Jábir ibn Hayyán and other Muslim scientists considered Balínús a natural philosopher and attributed several cosmological, astrological, and alchemical treatises to him. These include *Kitab al-Ahjar 'alá ra'y Balinas* and *Kitáb at-Talásim al-Akbar* (The Great Book of Talismans). The *Kitab al-Ahjar* (Book of Stones) by Jabir ibn Hayyan contains a lengthy analysis of alchemical works attributed to Apollonius.\n\n**Significance of the Emerald Tablet:**\n\n*   **Foundational Text of Alchemy:** The Emerald Tablet (Tabula Smaragdina) became a foundational text of alchemy. It was highly regarded by Islamic and European alchemists.\n*   **Origins:** The earliest known versions of the Emerald Tablet are four Arabic recensions preserved in mystical and alchemical treatises between the 8th and 10th centuries CE. These are found chiefly in the *Secret of Creation (Sirr al-Khalīqa)* and the *Secret of Secrets (Sirr al-Asrār)*.\n*   **Content:** The Emerald Tablet is a compact and cryptic text attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. It is believed to contain the secrets of the alchemical process and the creation of the philosopher's stone. The most famous line, \"As above, so below,\" expresses the Hermetic principle that the macrocosm (the universe) is reflected in the microcosm. The text introduces the theory that all metals are formed from sulphur and mercury, a foundational concept in medieval alchemy. It outlines the alchemical process of \"solve et coagula\" (dissolve and coagulate).\n*   **Discovery Narrative:** The Emerald Tablet was often accompanied by a frame story about its discovery in Hermes' tomb. Balinus's version describes finding the tablet in a crypt beneath a statue of Hermes in Tyana.\n*   **Influence:** The Emerald Tablet has been influential in both Western and Islamic alchemical traditions. From the 12th century onward, Latin translations introduced the text to Europe, attracting scholarly interest. Medieval commentators interpreted it as a foundational text for producing the philosopher's stone and making gold. During the Renaissance, it was read through Neoplatonic, allegorical, and Christian lenses.\n*   **Possible Origins:** Some scholars believe the Emerald Tablet may be a translation of an older Greek or Syriac original, while others think it was an original Arabic composition based on older materials. The Arabic text presents itself as a translation of a work by Apollonius of Tyana.\n\nIn summary, Apollonius of Tyana (Balinus) is a key figure in Islamic alchemy due to the attribution of *Sirr al-Khaliqa* and his association with the discovery of the Emerald Tablet, a foundational text in alchemy. The Emerald Tablet's cryptic content and its connection to Hermes Trismegistus have made it a subject of fascination and interpretation for centuries.\n"

The Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, has remained unsolved for nearly 300 years. Another old unsolved math problem is whether any odd perfect numbers exist.\n\n**2. Challenges in Modern Mathematics Education:**\n\n*   A study in early 2025 identified challenges faced by students learning mathematics, including negative attitudes, difficult assessment tasks, and a lack of effective teaching methods. Attitude towards mathematics emerged as the most significant issue.\n*   Insufficient modern teaching equipment, power interruptions, and a lack of teacher skills in using technology also pose challenges in mathematics education.\n\n**3.

Some of the most well-known and challenging unsolved problems include the Millennium Prize Problems, established by the Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) in 2000. The CMI has offered a $1 million prize for the first correct solution to each of these problems.\n\n**Millennium Prize Problems:**\n\n*   **The Riemann Hypothesis:** This hypothesis concerns the distribution of prime numbers and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. It suggests that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have a real part equal to 1/2.\n*   **P versus NP:** This problem in computer science asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. In other words, if a solution to a problem can be easily checked, can a solution be easily found?\n*   **Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness:** The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluids. This problem seeks to prove or disprove the existence of smooth, globally defined solutions to these equations in three dimensions.\n*   **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture:** This conjecture deals with elliptic curves and their rational points. It suggests a deep connection between the number of rational points on an elliptic curve and the behavior of an associated L-function at a specific point.\n*   **Hodge Conjecture:** This problem in algebraic geometry proposes that certain cohomology classes are algebraic, meaning they can be represented by algebraic cycles.\n*   **Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap:** This problem is related to quantum field theory and the existence of a mass gap. It seeks to establish the existence of a quantum field theory that satisfies the Yang-Mills equations and has a positive mass gap.\n\n**Other Unsolved Problems:**\n\nBesides the Millennium Prize Problems, other notable unsolved problems in mathematics include:\n\n*   **Goldbach's Conjecture:** This conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.\n*   **Twin Prime Conjecture:** This conjecture posits that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2.\n*   **Collatz Conjecture:** This conjecture involves a simple iterative sequence applied to natural numbers. Start with any natural number. If the number is even, divide it by 2; if it's odd, triple it and add 1. The conjecture is that this process will eventually reach 1, regardless of the starting number.\n*   **The Odd Perfect Number Problem:** Do any odd perfect numbers exist? A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself).\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n*   In May 2025, a mathematician at UNSW Sydney introduced a new approach to solving high-degree polynomial equations, which had been considered unsolvable for centuries.\n*   In April 2025, mathematicians made progress on the Kakeya set problem in geometric measure theory.\n\nIt's worth noting that predicting which of these problems will be solved in the near future is difficult. The difficulty levels vary significantly, and breakthroughs can come unexpectedly. Some, like the Collatz Conjecture, are easily understood but notoriously difficult to prove. Others, like the Riemann Hypothesis, require deep knowledge of advanced mathematical concepts.\n"

Note that I count \"users have to compile the application\" as worse UX than Python, which either requires no compilation in the first place or allows publishing prebuilt wheels.",
      "ai_message": "To achieve a similar user experience for Rust applications as Python's entrypoint system, focusing on easy plugin installation, several approaches can be considered, keeping in mind the challenges Rust presents with ABI stability and precompiled binaries.\n\n**1. Leveraging Cargo for Plugin Management:**\n\nCargo, Rust's package manager, can be central to plugin management [rust-dd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [moldstud](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [crates](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). One approach involves generating a temporary crate with the required plugins as dependencies [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).  `Cargo-make` can also streamline task automation and integration with Cargo [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8).\n\n**2. Plugin System Architectures:**\n\nSeveral plugin system architectures can be employed, each with trade-offs:\n\n*   **Dynamic Linking:** While offering near-native speed [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4), [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0), [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0), [arroyo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1), [docs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2), dynamic linking suffers from ABI stability issues due to Rust's lack of a version-independent ABI [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4), [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0), [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4), [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5).  Using a C ABI can provide a stable interface [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4), [arroyo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4), with a Rust layer built on top for a more Rust-like API [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4). Crates like `abi_stable` [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1) or `stabby` [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3) can also help create stable ABIs.  The `cglue` crate achieves ABI stability through opaque types [nullderef](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-2).\n*   **WebAssembly (Wasm):** Wasm offers a balance of security and performance with sandboxing [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4), [nullderef](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5), [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0]. Plugins can be written in any language that compiles to Wasm [nullderef](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** IPC provides sandboxing and supports multiple languages [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6), [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7), [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1), [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4), [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6), allowing for graceful handling of plugin crashes [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6).\n\n**3. Addressing Challenges with Precompiled Binaries:**\n\nDistributing pre-built Rust libraries is problematic because they are only guaranteed to work if built with the exact same compiler and dependencies [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).  Consider these points:\n\n*   **Security:** Using precompiled binaries, especially procedural macros, raises security concerns [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4), [matejknopp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-17]. Auditing both the macro and generated code is crucial [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n*   **Versioning:**  A clear versioning system is essential [oxidemod](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5), [oxidemod](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6].\n*   **Alternatives:** Distributing source code and rebuilding dependencies for each consumer is a viable approach [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n\n**4. Relevant Crates and Tools:**\n\n*   `plugin-interfaces`: Defines a standardized plugin architecture [crates](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).\n*   `vx_plugin`: Provides the core plugin architecture for the vx Universal Development Tool Manager [docs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9).\n*   `plugy`: A plugin system designed for WebAssembly [docs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-11).\n*   `plugin-system`: A Rust project plugin management system using Cargo [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [crates](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n*   `cargo-quickinstall`: Fetches prebuilt binaries if available [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-13).\n*   `inventory`: Sets up a plugin registry [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-14).\n\n**5. Comparison to Python:**\n\nUnlike Python, where code is distributed without compilation and is platform-independent [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-12], Rust requires more attention to ABI stability [dev](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nGiven the challenges with ABI stability and precompiled binaries in Rust, a combination of approaches might be best:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Wasm or IPC:** These offer better security and platform compatibility compared to dynamic linking alone [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4), [nullderef](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5], [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6), [rust-lang](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7).\n2.  **Use Cargo for Dependency Management:** Leverage Cargo to manage plugin dependencies, simplifying library integration [moldstud](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n3.  **Provide Precompiled Binaries with Caveats:** If precompiled binaries are offered, clearly communicate the required compiler version and dependencies. Consider providing source code as an alternative.\n4.  **Implement Robust Security Measures:**  Strict validation, sanitization, and minimizing `unsafe` code are crucial [corgea](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7]. Regularly review and update dependencies [sonatype](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8].\n\nBy carefully considering these factors, you can create a Rust plugin system that offers a user-friendly experience comparable to Python's, while addressing the unique challenges of the Rust ecosystem.",

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent information on \"Rust plugin system precompiled binaries\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nRust plugin systems are being developed using various approaches, each with its own trade-offs. Here's a summary of the key findings regarding precompiled binaries in Rust plugin systems:\n\n**Approaches to Plugin Systems in Rust:**\n\n*   **Dynamic Linking:** This method involves dynamically loading libraries as plugins, offering near-native speed. However, it can suffer from ABI stability issues and security concerns related to memory access. Rust's lack of a version-independent ABI makes this approach more challenging.\n*   **C ABI with Rust Wrapper:** This involves exposing a C Application Binary Interface (ABI) and writing a safe Rust wrapper around it. This provides wide language support due to C's ubiquity and a stable ABI. However, it may introduce performance overhead from Foreign Function Interface (FFI) calls and increased complexity in managing memory safety.\n*   **ABI-Stable Rust Types:** This method utilizes ABI-stable types through crates like `abi_stable` or `stabby`. It maintains Rust's safety guarantees and can fully leverage Rust's type system, potentially offering better performance than C FFI. However, each ABI-unstable type would need to be reimplemented, adding complexity for plugin writers.\n*   **Custom ABI Stabilization via Rust Compiler:** This approach involves utilizing `rustc_driver` and/or `rustc_interface` to stabilize the ABI through compiler-level interventions and developing a custom wrapper to compile everything. This potentially offers the best performance, maintains Rust's safety guarantees, allows fine-grained control over the ABI, and fully leverages Rust's type system, potentially providing the best plugin developer experience. However, it requires in-depth knowledge of the Rust compiler.\n*   **WebAssembly (Wasm):** Wasm offers a way to achieve near-native speed, strong sandboxing, and platform compatibility. It's a low-level, binary instruction format designed to run in web browsers, serving as a compilation target for languages like C, C++, Rust, and Go.\n\n**Precompiled Binaries and Rust Plugins:**\n\n*   **Distribution:** SWC (an extensible Rust-based platform) can be downloaded and used as a pre-built binary or built from source. Pre-compiled binaries are provided for various operating systems and architectures.\n*   **Challenges:** Distributing pre-built Rust libraries can be problematic because a pre-built Rust library is only guaranteed to work if it's built with the exact same SHA of the compiler and the exact same set of dependencies.\n*   **Security:** Using precompiled binaries, especially procedural macros, can raise security concerns. Even with sandboxing, the generated code can potentially perform arbitrary actions. Auditing both the macro itself and any code generated by the macro is crucial.\n*   **Versioning:** To manage compiler versions, a specific `rustc` binary can be placed in a designated path, with the wrapper configured to use this specific binary.\n*   **Alternative:** Instead of precompiled binaries, distributing source code and rebuilding dependencies for each consumer can be a viable approach.\n\n**Considerations for Plugin Development:**\n\n*   **Language Support:** Limiting plugin development to specific languages and frameworks can ensure a healthy plugin ecosystem.\n*   **ABI Stability:** Assuring ABI stability is error-prone, and doing it wrong doesn't always lead to immediate errors.\n*   **Dynamic vs. Static Linking:** Dynamic linking can reduce compile times, even with a single plugin.\n*   **Sandboxing:** Using IPC (Inter-Process Communication) provides proper sandboxing via the OS, offering a significant security benefit for most use cases of plugin systems.\n*   **Apollo Router:** Apollo doesn't recommend creating native plugins for the Apollo Router Core or GraphOS Router due to the requirement of familiarity with Rust and compiling a custom router binary from source. They suggest using Rhai scripts or external coprocessors instead.\n\n**Example of Implementation**\n\n*   One approach involves implementing a C/System ABI interface for plugins and a Rust wrapper around that ABI to enable ergonomic Rust plugins. This allows code reuse between plugins using crates.io. However, plugins must be compiled, and there is no sandboxing.\n\n**Overall,** while precompiled binaries can offer convenience, they also introduce challenges related to ABI stability, security, and compiler versioning. Developers need to carefully consider these trade-offs when designing a Rust plugin system.\n"

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on \"Rust plugin system dynamic linking\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nRust's plugin system often utilizes dynamic linking to load libraries at runtime, enabling extensibility in applications. Here's a summary of key aspects:\n\n**1. Core Concepts and Benefits:**\n\n*   **Extensibility:** Dynamic linking allows applications to support user-defined functions (UDFs) and other extensions, adapting to a wide variety of use cases.\n*   **Shared Libraries:** Shared objects (`.dll` on Windows, `.so` on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS) are a common way to distribute library code.\n*   **Dynamic Linking:** Applications only need to know the interface at compile time, not the actual code, and can even load code after startup.\n*   **Reduced Compilation Time:** Dynamically linked plugins can reduce build times because changes in one plugin don't require recompilation of the entire project.\n*   **Sharing Dependencies:** Dynamic linking makes it possible to share library dependencies among plugins.\n*   **Safety:** Rust's safety features can make working with plugins challenging, as compile-time checking can be lost. Libraries like `dynamic_plugin` aim to reintroduce safety when writing plugin libraries that are loaded at runtime.\n\n**2. Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Foreign Function Interface (FFI):** Many plugin systems in Rust use FFI to interact with dynamically linked code.\n*   **C ABI:** Using a C ABI is a common approach for creating plugins, as it provides a stable and portable interface. A Rust layer can be built on top of the raw shared lib/C ABI to provide a more Rust-like API.\n*   **`cdylib` Crate Type:** Compiling a crate as `cdylib` creates a C-style dynamic library that can be loaded using crates like `dlopen` or `libloading`.\n*   **`extern \"C\"` and `#[no_mangle]`:**  `extern \"C\"` functions with `#[no_mangle]` can be loaded from the dynamic library.\n*   **Crate Types:** To create a dynamic library that plugins can link to, the `Cargo.toml` file needs to be configured to compile the app as a dynamic library. This is done by adding `crate-type = [\"dylib\", \"rlib\"]` to the `[lib]` section. The `dylib` creates the `.so` shared library, and the `rlib` provides Rust with metadata for linking plugins at compile time.\n\n**3. Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n*   **ABI Stability:** Rust's ABI is not stable, which can make it difficult to load code between different Rust versions.\n*   **Unloading Issues:** Unloading dynamic libraries can be problematic, and no language seems to handle unloading well.\n*   **Dependency Management:** Most crates are not `dylib`, which can cause them to be glued to your artifact. Re-exporting the crate using `cargo-dynamic` can help with sharing code between plugins.\n*   **Global Objects:** Unloading `.so` files under glibc is difficult if there are any global objects in it.\n*   **Plugin Compatibility:** Plugin setups may not work for all applications, especially larger projects with many dependencies.\n*   **Security:** Dynamic linking can introduce security concerns if the dynamic libraries are changed without recompiling the binaries that depend on them.\n\n**4. Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   **Real-time SQL Engine (Arroyo):** Arroyo uses a dynamically-linked, FFI-based plugin system to support user-defined functions in its stream processing engine.\n*   **Game Engines:** Game engines like Fyrox use hot reloading of Rust plugins for faster development.\n*   **Internet Simulators:** Dynamic linking can be used to create node plugins for internet simulators.\n\n**5. Alternatives to Dynamic Linking:**\n\n*   **WebAssembly (Wasm):** Wasm can be used as an alternative for plugins, with runtimes like Wasmtime or CraneLift.\n*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Hosting plugins in their own processes and communicating over IPC channels is another option.\n\n**6. Recent Developments:**\n\n*   **Redox OS:** Redox OS has implemented dynamic linking as the default build method for many recipes, which is a step towards a stable ABI.\n*   **Arroyo's Plugin System:** Arroyo has transitioned from Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation to a dynamically-linked, FFI-based plugin system with support for sync and async functions.\n"

          "output": "It appears you're asking about the best practices for distributing and managing Rust plugins as precompiled binaries, with a focus on ABI stability, security, and versioning, and how these compare to Python. You're also asking about tools to automate or simplify this process. Here's a breakdown of the information I found: \n\n **1. Best Practices for Distributing and Managing Rust Plugins** \n\n *   **ABI Stability:** \n *   Rust doesn't guarantee a stable ABI, even between different runs of the compiler with the same version. This can lead to plugin incompatibility. \n *   The `abi_stable` crate helps create stable ABIs, even with complex features like trait objects. It's useful for Rust-to-Rust ABI stability, such as when creating a plugin system. However, `abi_stable` itself isn't permanently backward compatible. \n *   `stabby` is another crate built to address the lack of ABI stability in Rust, which can make writing plugins painful. \n *   One approach to achieve ABI stability is through opaque types, where the concrete layout isn't known. Interaction occurs via void pointers and associated vtables. \n *   Using a C ABI can provide a stable interface, as C has a stable ABI on major OSes and processor architectures. \n\n *   **Security:** \n *   Avoid including malicious code that could harm the server or players, invade privacy, or violate the game's terms of service. This includes backdoors, spyware, intentional memory leaks, and data miners. \n *   Consider penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities by simulating attacks. \n *   Treat all external input as untrusted and perform strict validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks. \n *   Minimize the use of `unsafe` code, as mistakes can lead to memory errors. \n *   Use safe concurrency primitives to avoid data races. \n *   Regularly review and update dependencies to mitigate security vulnerabilities in outdated libraries. \n *   Be aware of how `unsafe` Rust is used in dependencies. \n *   Restrict file access to admin-only accounts and use SFTP instead of FTP to encrypt file transfers. \n *   Implement strong password policies. \n *   Consider sandboxing your game or the portion that interfaces with dynamic code, and use some form of IPC to communicate with the game. \n\n *   **Versioning:** \n *   Adopt a clear versioning system to track changes and provide users with a reliable way to identify different plugin versions. \n *   Whenever you update a plugin, communicate these changes to your users through a version history document, a change log, or update notes. \n *   It's good practice to maintain a changelog with a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version. \n\n *   **General Best Practices:** \n *   Keep your Rust plugins updated to fix bugs, add new features, improve performance/compatibility, and enhance security. \n *   Use source control (like Git) for tracking changes, maintaining version history, and collaboration. \n *   Engage with your user community. \n *   Thoroughly test your plugins. \n *   Conduct code reviews. \n *   Provide clear and detailed documentation. \n *   Avoid assertions and configure error logging. \n *   Compile your WebAssembly code to achieve the best execution speed. \n *   Avoid copying data into HTTP contexts; share pointers or references instead. \n *   Avoid creating unnecessary load on the server. Minimize expensive operations and avoid blocking operations on the main game thread. \n\n **2. Comparison to Python Plugin Management** \n\n *   **Rust:** Requires more attention to ABI stability due to the lack of a stable ABI. \n *   **Python:** Python code is distributed without compilation and is platform-independent. Installing wheels creates `.pyc` files on the fly (Python bytecode). \n\n **3. Tools and Frameworks** \n\n *   **For Rust:** \n *   `abi_stable` crate: Facilitates stable ABIs. \n *   `stabby` crate: Aims to create stable binary interfaces. \n *   `cglue` crate: Achieves ABI stability through opaque types. \n *   `cargo-quickinstall`: A Cargo plugin that fetches prebuilt binaries if available. \n *   `inventory`:  A crate for setting up a plugin registry where plugins can be registered from any source file linked into your application. \n *   `Setuptools-rust`: A plugin for setuptools to build Rust Python extensions implemented with PyO3 or rust-cpython. \n\n *   **For automating updates:** \n *   Powershell scripts can automate updating plugins. \n\n *   **For integrating Rust and Python:** \n *   `PyO3`:  A framework to write native Python modules in Rust. \n *   `Maturin`: Manages creating, building, packaging, and distributing mixed Python/Rust projects. \n\n **4. Security Considerations for Precompiled Binaries** \n\n *   Distributing binaries increases the risk of distributing malicious code. \n *   Binaries are more difficult to audit. \n *   Consider using tools that analyze Rust dependencies for vulnerabilities. \n\n This information should give you a solid foundation for understanding the best practices for distributing and managing Rust plugins.\n"

          "output": "\"八九六四事件\", also known as the June Fourth Incident, the Tiananmen Square protests, or the Tiananmen Square Massacre, refers to the student-led demonstrations that took place in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, in the spring of 1989. The protests, which lasted from April 15 to June 4, 1989, called for broader political and economic reforms, including an end to corruption, censorship, and limits on basic rights.\n\nThe protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang, a pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary, in April 1989. Students gathered in Tiananmen Square to mourn his death and demand democratic reforms. These demonstrations grew, attracting widespread public support from various segments of Chinese society, including workers, pensioners, veterans, farmers, and ordinary citizens. By May 17, 1989, the protests had grown to involve over a million marchers.\n\nThe Chinese government initially responded with warnings but ultimately decided to suppress the demonstrations. Martial law was declared on May 20, 1989, as tensions escalated. On the night of June 3 and 4, 1989, the government deployed troops and tanks to Tiananmen Square, opening fire on and crushing those who tried to block their path. The events of June 3-4 are often referred to as the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Chinese government arrested thousands of suspected dissidents, many of whom received prison sentences, and some were executed. Several dissident leaders managed to escape China and seek refuge in the West. The crackdown led to international condemnation and the imposition of arms embargoes by Western countries.\n\nThe Chinese government has used various terms to describe the event, including \"counter-revolutionary rebellion,\" \"riot,\" \"political turmoil,\" and \"1989 storm\". Outside mainland China, it is often referred to as the \"June Fourth Massacre\" or \"June Fourth Crackdown\". Discussion of the Tiananmen Square tragedy remains censored on the Chinese internet.\n"

          "output": "After the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, the Chinese government implemented a series of measures to suppress dissent and control information. These actions have had a lasting impact on Chinese society and continue to shape the political landscape.\n\n**Crackdown and Political Control:**\n\n*   **Arrests and Silencing of Dissidents:** Following the Tiananmen Massacre, the government arrested thousands of people, many of whom were charged with \"counterrevolution\" and other crimes. Survivors were silenced, imprisoned, or exiled.\n*   **Censorship and Propaganda:** The government banned any public commemoration or mention of the June 4 crackdown, scrubbing references from the internet and controlling media coverage. The \"Patriotic Education Campaign\" was launched in the 1990s to transform schools into forums for patriotic education.\n*   **Tightened Security:** Security measures were reinforced around Tiananmen Square to prevent any form of protest. The government invested heavily in police riot control units.\n*   **Restrictions on Freedom of Expression:** The government continues to suppress dissent and violate the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\n\n**Information Control:**\n\n*   **Internet Censorship:** China has developed a sophisticated content-filtering system, often referred to as the \"Great Firewall,\" to control online information. Sensitive material is blocked, and users may encounter incorrect search results, deleted accounts, or police interrogation.\n*   **Media Control:** The government controls national media and the education system, ensuring no reports about the events at Tiananmen Square are published.\n*   **Suppression of Historical Information:** The government aims to erase the Tiananmen Square crackdown from collective memory, particularly among the younger generation.\n\n**Impact on Hong Kong:**\n\n*   **National Security Law:** Since mid-2020, the government has extended its control to Hong Kong, imposing the National Security Law, which outlaws most political dissent.\n*   **Banning of Commemorations:** The annual Tiananmen Massacre vigil in Hong Kong has been forbidden, and organizers have been arrested.\n\n**Ongoing Efforts to Suppress Dissent:**\n\n*   **\"Stability Maintenance\" Campaigns:** Each year, authorities conduct \"stability maintenance\" campaigns, placing government critics, political activists, and outspoken parents of those who died in the crackdown under house arrest or taking them outside Beijing.\n*   **Surveillance and Harassment:** Dissidents and their families, even those living abroad, are often subjected to surveillance, harassment, and threats.\n*   **Economic Measures:** Bank accounts of activists and their families in China and Hong Kong have been frozen.\n\nThe Chinese government's actions after the Tiananmen Square protests reflect a continued effort to suppress dissent, control information, and maintain the Communist Party's grip on power. These measures have had a profound impact on Chinese society, limiting freedom of expression and shaping the collective memory of the events of 1989.\n"

The Masters turned on him, and he was chained, stabbed, devoured, drowned, and thrown down a well.\n*   Despite this, something of Mr. Eaten remains, described as a gnawing hunger.\n\n**Seeking Mr. Eaten's Name**\n\n*   \"Seeking Mr Eaten's Name\" (SMEN) is a storyline in *Fallen London* known for its self-destructive and difficult nature. It is described as a curse or a ghastly obsession that ruins the player character's life.\n*   The quest involves giving up tangible resources and stats in pursuit of a nihilistic goal, with warnings of pain, suffering, and no happy ending. The game itself breaks character to advise against continuing the quest.\n*   The storyline is optional, and players are given multiple warnings before and during the quest.\n*   The goal of the quest is to discover Mr. Eaten's name, which involves reconstructing it by carving yourself into little bitty pieces.\n*   The quest plays by different rules than the rest of *Fallen London*, and can be capricious and unfair.\n\n**Name Acquisition**\n\n*   The phrase \"seeking the name\" refers to the player character's attempt to discover the true identity of Mr. Eaten.\n*   The search for the name is less about the destination and more about the self-destruction along the way.\n*   Acquiring the name requires savage ordeals that consume abilities and resources.\n*   The player may start thinking, \"once I know who Mr Eaten is, what will I do about it?\"\n\n**Consequences of Seeking the Name**\n\n*   The quest can strip characters of their stats, possessions, and wealth.\n*   Players may lose their lodgings and overcapped stats.\n*   The game may require a Watchful stat of 200 to progress.\n*   If the player abandons the quest at the end, they receive a unique item.

The game itself warns players to turn back, as the quest leads to pain and suffering.\n*   **A Name Beyond Understanding:** Some theories suggest that Mr. Eaten's name isn't a name in the traditional sense, but more of an affliction. The quest to discover it becomes more about the journey of self-destruction and the changes it brings.\n*   **Connection to the Judgements:** There is a theory that Mr. Candles was a Judgement in disguise, drawing parallels between Mr. Eaten and the storm that speaks from Sunless Skies, a ghost of a dead Judgement.\n*   **Reckoning:** Mr. Eaten's return is associated with a reckoning that was postponed by the Masters and cannot be delayed indefinitely.\n"

One source mentions losing half your stats in a single click. Another states a sacrifice of 500 CP of all four main stats, which is about 8 levels.\n*   **Menaces:** The quest frequently increases menaces like Nightmares, Suspicion, Wounds, and Scandal. High menace levels can lead to removal to side locations like the Tomb-Colonies.\n\n**Possessions and Wealth:**\n\n*   **Loss of items:** Players sacrifice hard-earned possessions, sometimes the rarest in the game, for a chance to progress.\n*   **Financial ruin:** The quest can lead to financial ruin. One player reported their net wealth dropping to 20% of what it was before starting the quest.\n*   **Loss of Lodgings:** All lodgings can be lost.\n*   **Unique Items:** Sacrificing items like an Overgoat, a Classic Short Story, Fluke-Cores, a Noman, or a Nearly-Daughter may be required.\n\n**Relationships and Status:**\n\n*   **Betrayal of friends and companions:** The quest requires betraying friends, spouses (including Fate-locked ones), and other NPCs.\n*   **Loss of renown:** All renown can be lost.\n*   **Loss of connections:** Large amounts of connections can be sacrificed.\n\n**Overall Progress and Character:**\n\n*   **Permanent character damage:** The quest is designed to damage the player character repeatedly.\n*   **Character Unusability:** Completion of the quest leaves the character permanently unplayable.\n*   **Irreversible effects:** Some effects, like being steeped in Obscurity, can lock players out of certain content.\n*   **Loss of Destiny:** It is possible to throw away your Destiny.\n\n**Approximate Value and Impact:**\n\nThe impact of these losses is severe, potentially setting back a player's progress significantly. The \"Seeking Mr. Eaten's Name\" quest is a story of self-destruction, where the pursuit of the Name devours all the progress a player has made. The game actively discourages players from continuing the quest, emphasizing that there will be no happy ending.\n"

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on \"platinum rhodium alloy catalysts oxygen reduction reaction stability activity \"scientific studies\"\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nPlatinum-based alloy electrocatalysts are promising materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, their high cost and insufficient durability hinder the commercialization of PEMFCs. Current research focuses on enhancing the activity and stability of these catalysts while reducing platinum loading.\n\n**Platinum-Rhodium Alloys**\nResearchers have fabricated core-shell platinum-rhodium alloy (PtRh/Pt) electrocatalysts for the ORR with ultra-high stability. A dendrite-like PtRh alloy catalyst, created via a one-pot synthetic method, undergoes structural evolution during accelerated durability testing, forming a Pt-rich surface through a \"self-healing\" effect. The segregation energy of rhodium atoms is higher than that of cobalt and nickel in similar core-shell structures. After 90,000 accelerated durability test cycles, the half-wave potential shifts negatively by only about 5 mV, and the mass activity remains at 88%, which is significantly more stable than commercial platinum-carbon catalysts.\n\n**Key Factors Influencing ORR Activity and Stability**\n\n*   **Alloying with Transition Metals:** Alloying platinum with transition metals like nickel, cobalt, iron, copper, and zinc can improve ORR activity and reduce Pt loading. The electrocatalytic ORR reactivity of platinum-nickel (111) single crystal facets is superior to that of (100) and (110) counterparts.\n*   **Electronic and Geometric Effects:** Alloying Pt with transition metals modifies its electronic structure, tailoring its oxygen binding energy and adjusting its ORR activity. Geometric strain and electronic ligand effects also play a role in increasing catalytic activity.\n*   **Surface Structure:** The surface morphology and electronic surface properties influence the kinetics of ORR. Pt-skin and Pt-skeleton structures exhibit different electrochemical properties.\n*   **D-band Center:** The d-band center of Pt alloys has a key relation to their catalytic performance. Shifts in the d-band center with Pt alloy composition are accompanied by changes in ORR activity.\n*   **Stability in Acidic Environments:** The acidic environment (pH < 1) and positive electrode potentials (>0.7 V vs RHE) can lead to selective metal corrosion and leaching of transition metals, gradually approaching the activity of pure Pt.\n*   **Operating Conditions:** Relative humidity and operating temperature impact the dissolution of non-noble metals and Pt mitigation. Low RH enhances stability, while increasing operating temperatures lead to growing degradation effects.\n\n**Strategies for Enhancing Stability**\n\n*   **Core-Shell Structures:** Fabricating core-shell structures, such as PtRh/Pt, can enhance stability by forming a Pt-rich surface during testing.\n*   **Ordered Intermetallic Alloys:** Exploring ordered intermetallic alloys of Pt, such as PtCo, can provide high stability and higher mass activity than commercial Pt/C.\n*   **Metal Doping:** Doping PtNi catalysts with metals like molybdenum (Mo) and molybdenum-rhodium (MoRh) can enhance ORR activity and stability.\n\n**Alternative Catalysts**\nSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) are considered promising non-precious metal alternatives for ORR due to their high atomic utilization and excellent catalytic performance.\n\n**Testing Methods**\nThe rotating disk electrode (RDE) is less suitable for assessing catalyst behavior under PEMFC operating conditions. Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half-cell setups are used to test catalyst performance under application-oriented conditions and higher current densities.\n"

The process involves controlling the reduction potential of Pt, Ag, and Rh by adding N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) into oleylamine (OAM), which leads to the reduction of Ag to form the core, followed by PtRh reduction and growth on the surface.\n*   **Wet Chemical Method:** A two-step wet chemical method can be used to synthesize homogeneous Pt nanodendrites (Pt NDs) with a PtIr shell.\n*   **Template-Free Self-Assembly:** A modified template-free self-assembly approach can be used to synthesize PtRh alloy 3D porous nanostructures with a tunable atomic ratio of Pt and Rh.\n*   **Chemical Reduction:** Pt-Rh nanowires (NWs) can be synthesized through chemical reduction of metallic precursors using formic acid at room temperature, without surfactants, templates, or stabilizing agents.\n\n**Influence on Catalyst Structure and Performance:**\n\n*   **Enhanced Activity and Stability:** Alloying Pt with other metals, such as Rh, decreases the consumption of Pt and optimizes its electronic structure, enhancing catalytic activity. PtRh alloys can exhibit better mass activity and stability than Pt/C catalysts.\n*   **Dendritic Morphology:** The dendritic nanostructure and the synergy between Pd and Pt in Pt-Pd core-shell dendritic nanostructures can significantly improve catalytic performance compared to commercial Pt/C. Well-organized dendritic morphology, along with a Pt-rich shell, contributes to high catalytic activity and superior stability for acidic ORR.\n*   **Structural Evolution:** PtRh nanodendrites undergo structural evolution, forming a Pt-rich surface during initial potential cycling, which resists dissolution. The synergy between the Pt-rich surface and the inner PtRh alloy suppresses further metal component dissolution, resulting in high durability.\n*   **Increased Active Sites:** The accumulation of PtRh particles on the surface increases the active contact area of the catalyst, providing abundant low-coordinate atoms as effective active sites. The uneven skin of nanocubes exposes abundant active sites and improves Pt utilization.\n*   **Improved CO Tolerance:** PtRh catalysts can display strengthened durability by maintaining mass activity after methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) cycles due to better CO tolerance.\n*   **Support Effects:** The choice of support material influences catalytic activity. For example, SnO2 can provide oxygen-containing species for the oxidation of intermediate species formed during ethanol dissociation, operating through a bifunctional mechanism.\n*   **Durability:** An ultradurable PtRh nanodendrite (PtRh ND) electrocatalyst retained 88% of its mass activity after an accelerated durability test for 90,000 cycles.\n\n**Key Factors Influencing ORR Performance:**\n\n*   **Crystal Face Structure:** The crystal face exposed by the Pt-based catalyst determines the atomic arrangement and electronic structure of the surface, which directly affects the electrochemical adsorption and decomposition of reactant molecules.\n*   **Strain and Ligand Effects:** Strain effects enhance the performance of Pt-based catalysts by adjusting the distance between Pt atoms to change their electronic structure. Ligand effects contribute to electron transfer between different atomic surfaces.\n*   **Particle Size:** Smaller particle sizes presented larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA), which exhibit higher mass activity and stability.\n"

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on the effect observed in dendrite-like PtRh alloy catalysts during accelerated durability testing, and how it contributes to the catalyst's stability and performance retention in the oxygen reduction reaction. I will then synthesize the information into a verifiable text artifact.\n\nThe effect observed in dendrite-like PtRh alloy catalysts during accelerated durability testing significantly contributes to the catalyst's stability and performance retention in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This effect primarily involves structural evolution and the formation of a Pt-rich surface, leading to enhanced durability and performance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key aspects:\n\n*   **Structural Evolution and Self-Healing Effect:** During initial potential cycling in accelerated durability tests, PtRh nanodendrites (NDs) undergo intense structural evolution, resulting in the formation of a Pt-rich surface. This Pt-rich surface is crucial for the catalyst's resistance to dissolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have revealed a \"self-healing\" effect, where the difference in dissolution energy between Pt and Rh atoms drives this structural evolution.\n\n*   **Enhanced Durability:** The formation of a Pt-rich surface, combined with the synergy between this surface and the inner PtRh alloy, suppresses further dissolution of metal components. This leads to ultrahigh durability. For instance, one study reported that a PtRh ND electrocatalyst retained 88% of its mass activity after 90,000 cycles in an accelerated durability test. Another study showed a loss of only 2.1% in mass activity (MA) and an increase of 12.0% in specific activity (SA) after 40,000 potential-scanning cycles. In comparison, Rh-Pt3Co/C catalyst maintained 92% of its mass activity after 170,000 potential cycles.\n\n*   **Performance Retention:** The unique structure of PtRh catalysts, including the dendritic morphology and Pt-rich shell, contributes to high catalytic activity and stability for the ORR. For example, a well-defined PtCo@Pt core-shell nanodendrite electrocatalyst exhibited a mass activity of 0.54 A mgPt-1, which is three times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. After an accelerated durability test (ADT) of 40,000 potential-scanning cycles, this catalyst showed only a 2.1% loss in MA and an impressive 12.0% increase in SA.\n\n*   **Inhibition of Metal Dissolution:** The addition of Rh to Pt-based alloys can inhibit the dissolution of other transition metals, further enhancing the durability of fuel cells. For example, Rh-Pt3Co/C catalyst demonstrates direct inhibition of Co dissolution.\n\n*   **Comparison to Commercial Catalysts:** PtRh alloy catalysts often exhibit superior stability compared to commercial platinum-carbon (Pt/C) catalysts. For example, after 90,000 accelerated durability test cycles, a PtRh/Pt catalyst's half-wave potential shifted negatively by only about 5 mV, and its mass activity remained at 88%.\n\nIn summary, the \"self-healing\" effect and the formation of a Pt-rich surface in dendrite-like PtRh alloy catalysts during accelerated durability testing are crucial for their stability and performance retention in the ORR. This structural evolution minimizes metal dissolution, enhances catalytic activity, and provides a promising avenue for designing durable Pt-based electrocatalysts for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).\n"

          "output": "The effect of platinum to rhodium ratios in PtRh alloy catalysts on their catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a complex topic with ongoing research. Here's a synthesis of findings:\n\n**1. General Effects of Alloying Pt with Rh:**\n\n*   Alloying platinum with other metals, including rhodium, is a strategy to lower the cost of Pt-based catalysts and enhance their catalytic activity due to geometric strain and electronic ligand effects.\n*   The addition of a secondary metal can change the d-band center and surface atomic arrangement, which alters the chemisorption of oxygen-containing species and impacts ORR kinetics.\n*   Rh can enhance the activity and durability of ORR electrocatalysts.\n\n**2. Activity and Stability Enhancement:**\n\n*   Rh-doped Pt nanowires showed enhanced ORR specific and mass activities compared to pure Pt nanowires.\n*   The accumulation of PtRh particles on the surface of a catalyst increases the active contact area and provides active sites.\n*   The PtRh alloy shell can hinder the precipitation of the Ag core, enhancing the performance and improving the stability of the catalyst.\n\n**3. Degradation Mechanisms and Stability Considerations:**\n\n*   Limited catalyst stability is a central factor limiting the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs.\n*   Degradation mechanisms affecting Pt–Rh catalysts are not fully understood. Particle detachment from the carbon support can be a primary degradation mechanism.\n*   Other degradation modes for Pt-based catalysts include particle dissolution, agglomeration, Ostwald ripening, and carbon corrosion.\n\n**4. Optimal Ratios and Performance:**\n\n*   A study using density functional theory (DFT) suggests that Rh provides long-term stability when added around 25%–30% (approximately) at wt. ratio to other active catalyst metals such as Pt.\n*   In one experiment, the Pt/Ag/Rh atomic ratio was directly determined by EDS to be 44.95/39.56/15.49, with a PtRh-rich shell.\n\n**5. Factors Influencing ORR Performance:**\n\n*   The ORR activity of Pt-M (M = other metal) shows a \"volcanic\" relationship with the spacing of Pt atoms and the number of d-band vacancies.\n*   The size of Pt nanoparticles can affect ORR activity and durability.\n*   The support material also plays a crucial role; for example, using Fe- and N-codoped carbon (Fe–N–C) can improve the durability of Pt nanoparticles.\n\n**6. Testing and Evaluation:**\n\n*   Electrocatalytic activity and stability are often tested using rotating disk electrode (RDE) and gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half-cells.\n*   Accelerated stress tests (AST) are used to evaluate the stability of electrocatalysts.\n\n**7. Challenges and Future Directions:**\n\n*   Achieving high activity and long-term durability remains a challenge.\n*   Further research is needed to explore the degradation mechanisms affecting Pt-Rh catalysts.\n*   Efforts should focus on enhancing the support–particle interaction to improve stability.\n"

          "output": "Okay, I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on \"How does the DeepSeek R1 model compare to other open source models such as Llama 3?\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nThe DeepSeek R1 model, released by Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, is an open-source reasoning model that has garnered attention for its performance and innovative training methods. It's a 671B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, with 37B activated parameters per token, trained using large-scale reinforcement learning with a focus on reasoning capabilities.\n\n**Performance and Benchmarks:**\n\n*   **Reasoning and Math:** DeepSeek R1 rivals or outperforms OpenAI's models in accuracy and depth of reasoning in many reasoning benchmarks. It demonstrates strong performance in mathematics benchmarks. For example, it scored 79.8% on AIME 2024 and 97.3% on MATH-500, surpassing OpenAI o1-1217 in the latter. The newer DeepSeek R1–0528 has improved accuracy on AIME 2024 from 79.8% to 91.4%.\n*   **Coding:** A1 models generally perform better in LiveCodeBench and CodeForces tasks. However, the DeepSeek R1–0528 has shown dramatic improvements in coding benchmarks.\n*   **General QA:** R1 often outperforms A1 in structured QA tasks.\n*   **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):** On MMLU, OpenAI o1-1217 slightly edges out DeepSeek-R1, scoring 91.8% compared to DeepSeek-R1's 90.8%. DeepSeek R1 achieves 90.8% on MMLU, while Llama 3 8B Instruct scores 68.4%.\n*   **Comparison to Llama 3:** DeepSeek-R1 outperforms in 2 benchmarks (GPQA, MMLU), while Llama 3.2 90B Instruct is better at 0 benchmarks. DeepSeek-R1 has a higher MATH-500 score (97.3% vs 97.0%) compared to Llama 3.1 Nemotron Ultra 253B v1.\n\n**Key Differences and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Context Window:** DeepSeek-R1 has a larger context window (131,072 tokens) compared to Llama 3 70B Instruct (8,000 tokens). DeepSeek-R1 accepts 131,072 input tokens compared to Llama 3.2 90B Instruct's 128,000 tokens.\n*   **Model Size:** DeepSeek-R1 has 581.0B more parameters than Llama 3.2 90B Instruct, making it 645.6% larger. DeepSeek-R1 has 418.0B more parameters than Llama 3.1 Nemotron Ultra 253B v1, making it 165.2% larger.\n*   **Pricing:** Llama 3 70B Instruct is roughly 3.7x cheaper compared to DeepSeek-R1 for input and output tokens. For input processing, DeepSeek-R1 ($0.55/1M tokens) is 1.6x more expensive than Llama 3.2 90B Instruct ($0.35/1M tokens). For output processing, DeepSeek-R1 ($2.19/1M tokens) is 5.5x more expensive than Llama 3.2 90B Instruct ($0.40/1M tokens).\n*   **Release Date:** DeepSeek-R1 was released on 2025-01-20, while Llama 3.1 Nemotron Ultra 253B v1 was released on 2025-04-07.\n*   **Strengths:** DeepSeek R1 is stronger in complex reasoning and math, while Llama 3.3 excels in text generation and multilingual tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is ideal for projects requiring extensive reasoning or long-context processing. Llama 3.3 is more suited for multilingual and coding tasks.\n*   **License:** The model weights for DeepSeek-R1 are licensed under the MIT License, supporting commercial use and modifications.\n\n**Distilled Models:**\n\nDeepSeek has also created distilled models by fine-tuning against several dense models using reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1. These distilled models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks.\n\n*   **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B:** Performs well on MATH-500 (93.9%).\n*   **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B:** Delivers top-tier performance on MATH-500 (94.5%) and achieves a strong score of 86.7% on AIME 2024.\n*   **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B:** Shines on MATH-500, scoring 92.8%.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDeepSeek R1 is a powerful open-source model excelling in reasoning and mathematical tasks. While Llama 3 may be more efficient for tasks like text generation and multilingual applications, DeepSeek R1 offers a compelling alternative for complex problem-solving, especially with its enhanced reasoning capabilities and larger context window. The choice between the models depends on the specific application and the balance between cost, performance, and required context length.\n"

          "output": "Here's a summary of the personality, psychology, physical characteristics, height, and perceived attractiveness of Meliodas, Gojo Satoru, and Satsuki Momoi, based on the search results:\n\n**Meliodas (Seven Deadly Sins)**\n\n*   **Personality:** Meliodas is generally portrayed as cool, chill, and laid-back, with a cheerful grin that hides a tragic past. He is known to be kind, forgiving, and fun to watch in a fight. However, he also has a perverted side. As the leader of the Seven Deadly Sins, his character is complex, with themes of love, sacrifice, and redemption.\n*   **Psychology:** Meliodas has a complex psychology stemming from a 3000-year journey of watching Elizabeth die repeatedly while concealing the truth from her. He needs to become the \"worst version\" of himself to free Elizabeth from a curse, hiding his pain behind a cheerful facade.\n*   **Physical Characteristics:** Meliodas is often drawn in ways intended to highlight his attractiveness. He is often mistaken for a child.\n*   **Height:** Meliodas's physical age is debated, with some fans estimating him to be around 13-14 years old in physical appearance, leading to him being mistaken for a kid.\n*   **Perceived Attractiveness:** Meliodas's appeal combines both his attractive qualities and the emotional depth he represents within the storyline. Social media plays a significant role in showcasing his visual appeal through fan art and videos.\n\n**Gojo Satoru (Jujutsu Kaisen)**\n\n*   **Personality:** Gojo is portrayed as a complex individual who is often sarcastic towards his students but hates the higher-ups in Jujutsu society. He appears easygoing with colleagues, friends, and students but is cold and ruthless toward those he dislikes. Gojo is confident, which sometimes makes him arrogant, but his arrogance is justified by his immense power. He is also selfish, caring, and funny. Despite his playful nature, he is pragmatic and intelligent.\n*   **Psychology:** Gojo's immense power may have rendered him out of touch with reality, categorizing humans as strong or weak. He is morally sound but arrogant, believing himself to be invincible. Despite his seemingly carefree attitude, he takes on duties that put him under pressure, and he can be remorseful in grave situations. Some analyses suggest he is lonely.\n*   **Physical Characteristics:** Gojo is a tall and slender man with white hair that is often spiked up. He has bright blue eyes that are usually covered by a black blindfold or dark sunglasses. He typically wears a high-collared black coat and trousers.\n*   **Height:** Gojo is over 6'3\" (190 cm).\n*   **Perceived Attractiveness:** Gojo is considered very attractive by many people. His overall color scheme is mostly monochromatic, with his dark purple uniform matching his hair and sapphire tones.\n\n**Satsuki Momoi (Kuroko's Basketball)**\n\n*   **Personality:** Satsuki Momoi is a stunning and compassionate presence with a heart of gold and a smile that lights up the court. She is inspired by the anime Kuroko's Basketball and brings warmth and kindness to every interaction, speaking with gentle sincerity and a soft voice that puts everyone at ease.\n*   **Height:** Satsuki Momoi is 5'3\" / 161cm tall.\n"

Examples include Salesforce's Trailblazer Community and DHL Supply Chain's Harbr Private Data Storefronts.\n*   **Data Exchange Platforms:** Creating a marketplace to trade data, combining first-party and third-party datasets with features like blockchain audit trails, API integration, and quality scoring.\n*   **Usage-Based Data Licensing:** Charging based on actual usage, offering flexibility for clients and aligning costs with value delivered, is effective for industries like logistics and medical imaging.

This model is good for attracting new users. Specialized and niche models can justify higher rates (~11-30%), while platforms trading commodities usually have lower rates (~1% to 8%).\n*   **Advertising Revenue:** Selling ad space on the platform to other businesses. This model requires significant traffic and engagement.\n*   **Data Monetization:** Collecting user data and selling it for market research or targeted advertising, ensuring ethical data collection and user consent.\n*   **White Labeling:** Offering versions of the app to other companies with their branding and customizations.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n*   **Choosing the Right Model:** Options include Data-as-a-Service (subscriptions), Insight-as-a-Service (analytics dashboards), and Data Marketplaces (commission-based platforms).\n*   **Blending Revenue Strategies:** Combining different monetization models can lead to higher revenue.

          "output": "Microaggressions, subtle and often unintentional slights directed towards minority groups, have a significant psychological impact, contributing to minority stress and affecting mental and physical health. Research indicates that these experiences can lead to increased rates of depression, anxiety, prolonged stress, trauma, and even physical health issues like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Key Impacts of Microaggressions:**\n\n*   **Mental Health:** Microaggressions are associated with increased anxiety, symptoms of depression, psychological distress, and lower self-esteem. They can create feelings of invisibility, anger, resentment, and isolation, impacting educational and professional experiences. For transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people, microaggressions are linked to gender dysphoria, depressive and anxious symptoms, and lower self-esteem.\n*   **Minority Stress:** Microaggressions contribute to minority stress, which is the stress that people face due to their marginalized identity. This stress can be classified into distal stressors (external events like discrimination and violence) and proximal stressors (internal processes like fear of rejection and internalized stigma).\n*   **Physical Health:** Exposure to microaggressions can result in physical health problems such as high blood pressure, gastrointestinal issues, sleep disturbances, and chronic stress.\n*   **Intersectionality:** The impact of microaggressions can be compounded when individuals experience them based on multiple marginalized identities, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. For example, Latinx LGBTQ+ young adults experience unique mental health challenges related to both racist microaggressions and LGBTQ-related minority stressors.\n*   **Impact on Specific Groups:** Black individuals experience structural uncertainties and racial microaggressions, leading to increased minority stress. Asian Americans deal with microaggressions that can undermine their sense of belonging. Refugees exposed to racial microaggressions may experience increased intolerance to uncertainty and minority stress.\n*   **Blunted Stress Response:** Racially marginalized individuals may demonstrate a blunted cortisol response (lower cortisol reactivity and recovery) to stress, which could be an important mechanism that explains the negative impact of microaggressions on health.\n*   **Distrust in Systems:** Experiencing microaggressions can lead to distrust in healthcare professionals and systems, resulting in delayed care, reduced utilization of services, and poor adherence to treatment plans.\n*   **Coping Mechanisms:** Active coping strategies in response to racial discrimination are correlated with lower depression scores, while passive coping is not. People dealing with minority stress may internalize negative stereotypes, hide their identities, or develop harmful coping mechanisms in response to rejection.\n\n**Forms of Microaggressions:**\n\n*   **Microinsults:** Rude and insensitive comments that demean a person's identity.\n*   **Microinvalidations:** Comments or behaviors that exclude or invalidate a person's thoughts, feelings, or experiences.\n*   **Microassaults:** Explicit and intentional discriminatory acts.\n\n**Addressing Microaggressions:**\n\n*   **Awareness and Education:** Raising awareness of the mental health effects of both everyday and major racial discrimination can help clinicians and educators better understand the experiences of young adults of color.\n*   **Policy and Intervention:** Healthcare policy should acknowledge minority stress, and therapeutic interventions should incorporate addressing minority stress as an important component of cultural competency.\n*   **Institutional Change:** Institutions should review their policies regarding microaggressions, reporting processes, and resources to support those affected and discourage the commission of microaggressions.\n*   **Integration of Theories:** There is a need to integrate minority stress theory with other critically-oriented theories, such as intersectionality, in research and intervention to eliminate mental health inequities.\n\nIt's important to note that it is not a person's identity (e.g., sexual orientation, gender, race) that inherently causes negative mental health outcomes, but rather the chronic exposure to minority stress from constant social stigmatization.\n"

It refers to the stress experienced by individuals due to their membership in a minority group, stemming from social stigmatization related to sexual orientation, gender, race, or ethnicity. This stress can arise from experiences of discrimination, violence, hate crimes, and microaggressions.\n\n**Key Aspects of Minority Stress in 2025:**\n\n*   **Impact on Mental Health:** Research consistently demonstrates that minority stress has significant implications for mental health outcomes across sexual orientation, gender, racial, and ethnic minorities. It is associated with increased rates of mental health challenges, including posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidality.\n*   **Distal vs. Proximal Stressors:** Minority stress is categorized into distal and proximal stressors. Distal stressors are external events like discrimination and hate crimes, while proximal stressors are internal processes such as internalized stigma and fear of rejection.\n*   **Intersectionality:** Individuals with multiple marginalized identities often face compounded discrimination and stressors, worsening mental health challenges. For example, a Black lesbian woman might face racism, sexism, and homophobia, each adding to her overall stress burden.\n*   **Workplace Impact:** Minority stressors in the workplace, such as discrimination and expectations of rejection, can negatively affect perceptions of workplace climate and increase depressive symptoms among LGBTQ+ employees.\n*   **Impact on Youth:** Gender minority stressors contribute to increased alcohol craving, psychological distress, and coping motives among transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth. Studies also indicate that positive affect can buffer the negative impact of gender minority stress on the mental well-being of TGD youth.\n*   **Moral Injury:** Minority stress can lead to moral injury among sexual and gender minorities (SGMs), with core themes including shame, guilt, betrayal/loss of trust, and attachment injuries.\n\n**Addressing Minority Stress and Promoting Emotional Safety:**\n\n*   **Therapeutic Interventions:** Therapists can use evidence-based interventions like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions to minority stress. Mindfulness practices and meditation can also reduce stress from discrimination.\n*   **Creating Safe and Affirming Spaces:** It is important to validate clients’ diverse identities and recognize the impact of systemic oppression. Affirming environments within the home and community are crucial for LGBTQ+ youth.\n*   **Community Support:** Encouraging participation in supportive communities and peer networks can provide a sense of belonging and build resilience against minority stress.\n*   **Reducing Stigma:** Open conversations and community advocates can help normalize mental health care and reduce stigma. Anti-discrimination education is also vital.\n*   **Promoting Resilience:** Interventions should focus on enhancing perceived workplace climate and promoting resilience to improve LGBTQ+ individuals' mental health. Factors like identity pride and community connectedness can help individuals cope with minority stress.\n*   **Focus on Social Safety:** Creating affirmative environments that signal social inclusion and protection is essential, as the absence of discrimination does not necessarily serve the same function.\n*   **Emotional Safety:** Emotional safety, which involves feeling confident in expressing oneself without fear of negative repercussions, is crucial for building trust and intimacy in relationships.\n"

          "output": "Specific examples of institutional policies and interventions that have demonstrably reduced microaggressions and promoted psychological safety within organizations and communities include:\n\n**1. Leadership & Policy Implementation:**\n\n*   **Clear Policies and Procedures:** Implementing clear policies for reporting and addressing microaggressions is vital. This includes anonymous reporting mechanisms and assurance of non-retaliation to make staff feel safe when coming forward.\n*   **Leadership Modeling:** Leaders must model inclusive behavior and take immediate action when issues are reported. They should encourage team members to share their thoughts, practice active listening and show empathy. Intervening when someone discourages others from speaking up is also crucial.\n*   **Commitment Devices:** Introducing commitment devices where leaders publicly pledge to create a psychologically safe environment can be effective. This could involve signing a charter or making regular public statements about the importance of psychological safety.\n*   **Accountability Structures:** Design a clear accountability structure to safeguard the program's integrity.\n\n**2. Education and Training:**\n\n*   **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Training:** Implementing DEI policies and educating teams on DEBI concepts helps people recognize and avoid microaggressions. Certificate programs can teach how to apply DEBI concepts in work settings and track progress.\n*   **Unconscious Bias Training:** Unconscious bias training raises awareness about biases and how they impact behavior and decision-making. It also teaches participants how to act on that awareness.\n*   **Microaggression Training:** Microaggression training equips employees with the awareness and skills to recognize and avoid subtle discriminatory behaviors. This helps teams build respect and empathy and minimize the occurrence of microaggressions.\n*   **Cultural Competency and Sensitivity Training:** Regular training sessions on cultural competency and sensitivity can help staff recognize and avoid microaggressions. Creating an open dialogue about the impact of these behaviors and encouraging staff to speak up when they witness them is also crucial.\n\n**3. Communication and Feedback:**\n\n*   **Open Communication:** Fostering open communication starts with creating spaces where employees feel comfortable sharing ideas, concerns, and feedback without fear of criticism. Leaders should ensure employees feel heard and valued by promoting honest dialogue and encouraging team members to voice their opinions.\n*   **Structured Feedback Processes:** Implement structured feedback processes that focus on specific behaviors rather than personal attributes. This can help reduce bias and increase the perception of fairness, making people more comfortable with giving and receiving feedback.\n*   **Framing and Reframing Failure:** Use language interventions to reframe failure as a learning opportunity. Introduce the concept of 'intelligent failures' or 'productive mistakes' in team discussions and performance reviews to reduce the fear associated with taking risks.\n*   **Anonymous Feedback Mechanisms:** Establishing anonymous feedback mechanisms allows employees to voice concerns without fear of retribution.\n\n**4. Promoting Inclusivity and Belonging:**\n\n*   **Employee Resource Groups (ERGs):** ERGs support underrepresented staff, boosting employee engagement.\n*   **Inclusive Hiring Procedures:** Inclusive hiring procedures and AI-based hiring systems can help various candidates obtain equal employment opportunities.\n*   **Diverse Teams:** Encourage cross-functional collaboration and team composition that reflects the diversity present in the organization. Diverse teams bring together individuals with unique insights and approaches, fostering innovation and creativity.\n*   **Micro-affirmations:** Train leaders and team members in the use of micro-affirmations, which are small gestures of inclusion and appreciation that can build psychological safety over time.\n*   **Leveling Power Gradients:** Reduce the power held or exhibited by the most powerful individuals and increase the power of the least powerful members. This can be achieved by addressing formal (organizational hierarchy), informal (tenure), or socially constructed (gender representation) power dynamics.\n\n**5. Ongoing Monitoring and Improvement:**\n\n*   **Regular Team Assessments:** Conduct regular team assessments to maintain workplace psychological safety over time.\n*   **Measuring and Monitoring Progress:** Regularly measure and monitor progress to ensure that efforts to increase psychological safety are effective and impactful.

I will conduct targeted Google Searches to gather the most recent, credible information on \"analogi tawassul dalam aqidah asy'ari\" and synthesize it into a verifiable text artifact.\nTawassul dalam Aqidah Asy'ari merujuk pada praktik menggunakan perantara dalam berdoa kepada Allah. Secara bahasa, tawassul berasal dari kata \"al-wasilah,\" yang berarti segala sesuatu yang digunakan untuk mendekatkan diri kepada yang lain. Dalam konteks Islam, wasilah adalah sesuatu yang dijadikan Allah sebagai penyebab keberuntungan di sisi-Nya dan perantara terkabulnya hajat. Sesuatu yang dijadikan wasilah ini memiliki daya dan kemuliaan di sisi Allah.\n\nKH. Hasyim Asy'ari, seorang tokoh penting dalam tradisi Islam di Indonesia, menjelaskan bahwa tawassul memiliki akar kata \"al-wasilah\" yang berarti sesuatu yang dijadikan Allah sebagai penyebab keberuntungan di sisi-Nya dan sebagai perantara terkabulnya hajat dari-Nya. Prinsipnya adalah, sesuatu yang dijadikan sebagai wasilah tersebut memiliki daya dan kemuliaan di sisi Allah.\n\n**Pandangan Ulama tentang Tawassul**\n\n*   **KH. Hasyim Asy'ari:** Menegaskan bahwa tidak ada larangan terhadap praktik tawassul. Menurutnya, tawassul dalam berbagai manifestasinya, baik melalui para Nabi, wali, atau orang-orang saleh, adalah praktik keagamaan Islam yang diperbolehkan.\n*   **Mayoritas Ulama:** Mayoritas umat Islam memperbolehkan tawassul dengan orang-orang yang memiliki keutamaan, sementara sebagian lain melarangnya.\n*   **Imam Taqiyyuddin as Subki:** Memandang bahwa bertawassul, beristighasah, dan memohon syafaat dengan Nabi Muhammad SAW adalah boleh dan baik.\n*   **Ulama Madzhab:** Ulama dari empat madzhab (Hanafi, Maliki, Syafi'i, dan Hanbali) sepakat memperbolehkan tawassul dengan para nabi dan orang saleh.\n*   **Tawassul yang Disepakati Boleh:**\n    *   Tawassul dengan iman dan amal ketaatan kepada Allah.\n    *   Tawassul dengan doa orang yang masih hidup.\n\n**Jenis-jenis Tawassul**\n\n*   **Tawassul yang Disepakati Boleh:** Tawassul dengan amal-amal saleh disepakati boleh oleh semua umat Islam.\n*   **Tawassul yang Diperdebatkan:** Tawassul dengan orang-orang yang memiliki keutamaan terdapat perbedaan pendapat. Mayoritas memperbolehkan, sementara yang lain melarangnya.\n*   **Tawassul yang Dilarang:** Bertawassul kepada Allah dengan sesuatu yang tidak ada syariatnya, seperti dengan kedudukan seseorang di sisi Allah atau dengan zat seseorang.\n\n**Perbedaan Pendapat dan Kontroversi**\n\nIbn Taimiyah diketahui menolak Istighatsah dan Tawassul. Namun, KH. Hasyim Asy'ari mengklarifikasi bahwa hadis yang diriwayatkan oleh Ibnu Taimiyah menegaskan bahwa tawassul diperbolehkan dan tidak mengurangi kemurnian tauhid. Kontra-tawassul baru muncul kurang lebih 200 tahun belakangan.\n\n**Tawassul dalam Konteks Kekinian**\n\nMasalah tawassul masih diperdebatkan di kalangan umat Islam. Ada yang menganggapnya sebagai hal yang фундаментально (ashliy), sementara yang lain menganggapnya hanya masalah cabang (far'iy).\n"

In the *Aqidah* (creed or belief system) of *Asy'ari*, a prominent theological school of thought in Sunni Islam, *tawassul* is a nuanced issue.\n\n**Key Points on Tawassul According to the Asy'ari School:**\n\n*   **Definition of *Wasilah***: *Wasilah* is defined as anything that Allah has made a means of drawing closer to Him and a link to obtaining one's needs from Him. It requires that the *wasilah* possess a degree of honor and virtue in the eyes of Allah.\n*   **Permissibility:** The majority of Islamic scholars, including those of the Asy'ari school, permit *tawassul*. KH. Hasyim Asy'ari, a prominent Indonesian Islamic scholar, asserted that there is no prohibition whatsoever on the practice of *tawassul*.\n*   **Forms of *Tawassul***: *Tawassul* is divided into two categories:\n    *   *Tawassul* through righteous deeds: This form is unanimously accepted by all Muslims.\n    *   *Tawassul* through individuals with virtue (Prophets, saints, righteous people): This form is accepted by the majority, while some others forbid it.\n*   **Arguments for permissibility**:\n    *   The Quranic verse Al-Maidah:35 encourages believers to seek a *wasilah* to draw closer to Allah.\n    *   Hadith traditions describe instances where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) taught his companions to make supplications using his status with Allah as an intercession.\n    *   The practice was common among the *Salaf* (early generations of Muslims) and has been consistently practiced throughout Islamic history.\n*   **Conditions for permissibility**:\n    *   One must believe that Allah is the only source of benefit and harm. The *wasilah* is only a means of seeking closeness to Allah.\n    *   One should not believe that the intermediary has power equal to or nearly equal to Allah.\n    *   The person performing *tawassul* should not worship the intermediary or consider them to be partners with Allah.\n*   **Views of KH Hasyim Asy'ari:** KH. Hasyim Asy'ari viewed *tawassul* through prophets, saints and pious people as permissible.\n*   **Contrasting Views:** Some groups, like the Wahhabis, strongly condemn *tawassul*, particularly seeking intercession from the deceased, considering it *haram* (forbidden) and an act of *shirk* (polytheism).\n*   **Ibnu Taimiyah's View**: Although some accuse Ibnu Taimiyah of rejecting *tawassul*, some sources suggest he permitted certain forms of it, not considering it as undermining the purity of *tawhid* (Islamic monotheism).\n*   **Misconceptions and Deviations:** Some practices associated with *tawassul*, such as seeking direct help from the deceased or attributing divine powers to intermediaries, are considered deviations from true Islamic teachings and may lead to *shirk*.\n\nIt is important to note that the issue of *tawassul* is complex and has been the subject of debate among Islamic scholars throughout history. The *Asy'ari* school, like other mainstream Sunni schools of thought, generally permits *tawassul* within certain guidelines, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the belief in the absolute oneness of Allah.\n"

The permissibility and justification for *tawassul*, particularly through prophets and saints, is explained and justified using various analogies and examples.\n\n**Core Concepts and Justifications:**\n\n*   **Intercession as a Sign of Honor:** One of the ways Allah honors prophets is by accepting their intercession for those for whom Allah has decreed mercy.\n*   **Prophet Muhammad as Intercessor:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is regarded as the primary intercessor. Ash'ari theology acknowledges the Prophet Muhammad as an intercessor, and that intercession can decrease the punishment of wrongdoers.\n*   **Intercession with Allah's Permission:** The Quran acknowledges intercession, but only with Allah's permission. Verses such as Quran 2:255, 10:3, 20:109, 21:28, 34:23 and 4:85 are interpreted to mean that intercession is granted by God's approval of the sinners.\n*   ***Tawassul* as Seeking Means:** *Tawassul* is considered a means to grow closer to Allah. The *tawassul* allowed by scholars is to ask Allah 'by the Prophet' or 'by the right of the Prophet'.\n*   ***Tawassul* is not worship:** Performing *tawassul* through the Prophet, a saint, or virtuous deeds is permitted and carries rewards. It is not considered a form of *shirk* (association of partners with Allah) or worship of anyone other than Allah.\n\n**Examples and Analogies:**\n\n*   **The Hadith of the Blind Man:** The story of the blind man who asked the Prophet Muhammad to pray for him is often cited. The Prophet (S) ordered him to perform *wudu* (ablution), recite two *rak'at* (units) of *salat* (prayer), and then make a specific *dua* (supplication). In the *dua*, the blind man says: \"O Lord! I request from Thee; I pay attention to Thee through (the channel) of your prophet Muhammad, Your blessed prophet. O Muhammad, I turn to my Lord for the fulfillment of my need through you so that my need is answered. O Lord, accept his intercession for me\".\n*   **Analogy to Seeking Help in This World:** Some scholars draw an analogy between seeking help from someone in this world and seeking intercession. Just as one might ask a respected person for assistance, one can ask a prophet or saint to intercede with Allah.\n*   **Love for the Pious:** When making *tawassul*, one highlights the lofty position of the person before Allah and one's love for him. The thing being presented before Allah is the 'love' and 'connection' with the Prophet, which is considered a righteous deed.\n*   **The People of the Cave:** Some Sufi writers use the story of the people of the cave to justify their *tawassul*.\n\n**Points of contention:**\n\n*   **Living vs. Deceased:** Some scholars differentiate between seeking intercession from the living and the deceased. The permissibility of *tawassul* through a deceased person is based on the belief that the positive meaning attached to the person remains in both life and death.\n*   **Direct vs. Indirect Requests:** A key point is that while *tawassul* is permitted, directly asking the one in the grave for help is not. In this form of *tawassul*, the worshiper knows that it is Allah Almighty who is being asked by means of the person.\n*   **Istighatha:** Some differentiate between permissible *tawassul* and *istighatha* (seeking help directly from deceased saints), with the latter being considered problematic.\n\nIt is important to note that while *tawassul* is accepted by many within the Ash'ari school, there are differing opinions and interpretations regarding its specific forms and limitations. Some scholars restrict *tawassul* to the Prophet Muhammad alone and do not extend it to other saints.\n"

          "output": "It's challenging to provide specific stock lending rates for Genial Investimentos and a direct comparison to other Brazilian brokerages due to the lack of real-time, comprehensive, and publicly available data. However, the search results offer valuable insights into the Brazilian stock lending market and factors influencing these rates as of July 2025.\n\nHere's a synthesis of the findings:\n\n**General Overview of Stock Lending in Brazil:**\n\n*   **Market Growth:** The Brazilian stock lending market has experienced substantial growth, with the volume of operations jumping from R$15 billion to R$52 billion monthly between 2019 and 2024. In 2023, the volume exceeded R$ 1 trillion.\n*   **Key Players:** B3 (Brasil Bolsa Balcão), the Brazilian stock exchange, rigorously regulates stock lending through BTC (Securities and Securities Bank). B3 acts as the central counterparty, ensuring the security of the process.\n*   **Typical Rates:** Fees typically range from 1.5% to 8% per year, but can reach as high as 20% depending on demand for the security. Average rates in Brazil are reportedly higher than in the US and Europe.\n*   **Participants:** The main participants are lenders (share owners), borrowers (investors), brokers (intermediaries), and B3/BTC.\n*   **Regulation:** The stock lending market in Brazil is centralized, with all transactions carried out by clearing and settlement entities authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil (CVM).\n\n**Factors Influencing Stock Lending Rates:**\n\n*   **Supply and Demand:** High demand for short selling can lead to fees exceeding 20% per year.\n*   **Asset Liquidity:** Ibovespa stocks typically have fees between 2% and 5% per year.\n*   **Volatility:** During periods of market uncertainty, fees can double.\n*   **Corporate Events:** Approaching extraordinary dividends can cause fees to reach 15% per year.\n*   **Available Quantity:** Stocks with reduced free float tend to have higher fees.\n\n**How Stock Lending Works:**\n\n*   Lenders register their shares in the BTC system.\n*   Borrowers make offers with defined rates and terms.\n*   Upon acceptance, the system temporarily transfers the assets.\n*   Lenders maintain rights to all earnings, such as dividends.\n*   At the end of the term, lenders automatically receive their shares back with the agreed remuneration.\n\n**Genial Investimentos:**\n\n*   Genial Investimentos offers securities lending services.\n*   They publish remuneration rates for securities lending transactions on their website and provide transaction confirmations detailing amounts received or paid.\n*   Genial Investimentos is mentioned as one of the Brazilian brokerage firms that considered a partnership with Banco do Brasil to offer equity-trading services.\n\n**Comparison with Other Brazilian Brokerages:**\n\n*   It's difficult to provide a precise comparison of rates without real-time data.\n*   Pocket Option is mentioned as a platform that allows users to compare rates between different brokers.\n*   Several online brokers operate in Brazil, including Interactive Brokers, XTB, TradeStation Global, NinjaTrader and Swissquote.\n\n**Fees and Taxation:**\n\n*   Brokers typically charge a fee of 0.25% to 1% for intermediating the operation.\n*   Income from stock lending fees is subject to a 15% income tax rate, withheld at the source.\n*   B3 also charges an annual fee of 0.25%.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Stock loan fees are an often-overlooked cost associated with shorting a stock.\n*   Traders should factor in all fees when determining the risk/reward ratio of their trades.\n*   The Brazilian market offers favorable conditions for stock lending, with average rates higher than those in the US and Europe.\n"

This measure eliminates the previous regressive tax table and differentiation between asset types.\n*   **Withholding Tax:** A single withholding income tax (IRRF) rate of 17.5% has been established for income from financial investments in Brazil, effective January 1, 2026.\n*   **Securities Lending:** MP No. 1,303 improves the rules applicable to securities lending transactions, addressing imbalances and imperfections in existing rules.\n*   **Taxation as Fixed Income:** Stock lending transactions are treated as fixed-income transactions and are subject to income tax withholding.\n\n**Specific Tax Implications for Stock Lending:**\n\n*   **Lenders (Donors):** Income from stock lending is taxed as fixed income with regressive rates based on the lending period.\n    *   22.5% for up to 180 days.\n    *   20% for 181-360 days.\n    *   17.5% for 361-720 days.\n    *   15% for over 720 days.\n    *   Tax is automatically withheld at the source.\n    *   Income must be included under \"Income Subject to Exclusive Taxation\" in the annual declaration.\n*   **Borrowers (Takers):** A 15% tax on monthly net gains applies for borrowers making short sales (20% for day-trade), requiring a specific DARF (tax form).\n*   **Losses:** Losses from lending cannot offset gains in other investment types. However, proven losses in financial investments can be offset against other income of the same nature within the DAA for up to five years. Losses realized up to December 31, 2025, follow the previous legislation.\n\n**How to Declare Stock Lending in Income Tax Return (IRPF):**\n\n1.  **Obtain Income Report:** The lender (donor) should have the income report sent by B3 (Brazilian stock exchange).\n2.  **Open IRPF Program:** Open the Income Tax Return program of the Federal Revenue Service for individuals.\n3.  **Select \"Rendimentos Sujeitos à Tributação Exclusiva/Definitiva\":** Choose the option \"Rendimentos Sujeitos à Tributação Exclusiva/Definitiva\" (Income Subject to Exclusive/Definitive Taxation) and select \"Novo\" (New).\n4.  **Select Code \"06 - Rendimentos de aplicações financeiras\":** Opt for code \"06 – Rendimentos de aplicações financeiras\" (Income from financial investments).\n5.  **Fill in Details:**\n    *   Select the holder of the rental income in the \"Tipo de Beneficiário\" (Type of Beneficiary) field.\n    *   Enter B3's CNPJ (09.346.601/0001-25) in the \"CNPJ da Fonte Pagadora\" (CNPJ of the Paying Source) field.\n    *   Use the name \"B3 S.A. – BRASIL, BOLSA, BALCAO\" in the paying source field.\n    *   Enter the net value referring to the total received in 2024, according to the income report.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **B3 Regulation:** In Brazil, B3 rigorously regulates stock lending through BTC (Securities and Securities Bank), requiring guarantees of 100% of the borrower's assets, thus eliminating the risk of default.\n*   **Genial Investimentos Role:** Genial Investimentos intermediates trades, charging operating costs according to their remuneration table. They also handle the fees charged by B3, transferring the amounts upon financial settlement and withholding any taxes owed by the client.\n*   **Provisional Measure 1.303/2025:** This measure brings comprehensive restructuring of taxation on financial investments, investment funds, virtual assets, and securities lending operations. It aims to align the Brazilian system with international models, expand the tax base, and correct distortions in the current regime.\n*   **New Rules:** MP No. 1,303 changes the special regime applicable to non-resident investors in investments made in the financial and capital markets, increasing the currently applicable income tax rate from 15% to 17.5%.\n\n**Tax Benefits:**\n\n*   Stock lending allows investors (lenders) to generate additional income (1.5% to 8% per year) from their assets without selling them.\n*   During the lending period, the owner retains rights to dividends, interest on equity, and other proceeds.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is based on the search results provided and should not be considered professional tax advice.

          "output": "The 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the 2021 Formula One World Championship, was held on December 12, 2021, at the Yas Marina Circuit. The race's final laps and the safety car period were highly controversial, leading to debates over the application of the rules and the role of the race director, Michael Masi.\n\n**Specific Reasons for the Safety Car Period**\nThe safety car was deployed on lap 53 after Nicholas Latifi crashed his Williams into the Turn 14 barriers. At the time of the crash, Lewis Hamilton led Max Verstappen by approximately 11 seconds. Mercedes chose not to pit Hamilton, as doing so would have conceded track position to Verstappen. Red Bull, however, used the opportunity to pit Verstappen for soft tires. After Verstappen's pit stop, five lapped cars (Lando Norris, Fernando Alonso, Esteban Ocon, Charles Leclerc, and Sebastian Vettel) were between him and Hamilton.\n\n**Controversies Surrounding the Safety Car Period**\nThe primary controversy stemmed from Race Director Michael Masi's handling of the safety car period and the subsequent restart of the race. Key points of contention included:\n*   **Partial Lapped Cars Un-Lapping:** Initially, lapped cars were told they would not be allowed to un-lap themselves. Then, with two laps remaining, Masi directed only the five cars between Hamilton and Verstappen to un-lap themselves. This decision allowed Verstappen to close up directly behind Hamilton.\n*   **Restart Procedure:** Article 48.12 of the sporting regulations states that \"once the last lapped car has passed the leader, the Safety Car will return to the pits at the end of the following lap\". However, Masi ended the safety car period and restarted the race on the same lap that the cars were allowed to un-lap themselves. This decision allowed for one final lap of racing.\n*   **Alleged Rule Violations:** The FIA's report acknowledged that Masi did not adhere to the regulations, specifically Article 48.12, which required the safety car to complete an additional lap after the last lapped car passed the leader before returning to the pits. Masi also bypassed the standard procedure by resuming the race on the very next lap instead of completing another full lap behind the safety car once the lapped cars had repositioned themselves.\n\n**Rules and Procedures Called Into Question**\nSeveral regulations and procedures were questioned because of the events in Abu Dhabi:\n*   **Safety Car Regulations:** The ambiguity in the wording of the regulations, particularly regarding the discretion afforded to the race director in deploying and withdrawing the safety car, was highlighted. The rule stating \"any\" lapped cars may unlap themselves was changed to \"all\" lapped cars must unlap themselves.\n*   **Role of the Race Director:** Masi's authority and decision-making process came under scrutiny, with many questioning whether his decisions were impartial and in line with the regulations. Communications between team principals and the race director were also criticized for being distracting.\n*   **Fairness and Sporting Integrity:** The decisions made during the safety car period led to accusations that the race was manipulated to provide a more exciting finish, potentially compromising the sport's integrity.\n\n**FIA Investigation and Outcomes**\nThe FIA conducted an inquiry into the events of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The key findings of the report, released on March 19, 2022, included:\n*   **Human Error:** The FIA acknowledged that \"human error\" was a factor in the controversy. The report found that the race director’s responsibilities should be divided.\n*   **Good Faith:** The FIA stated that Masi acted in \"good faith\" and to the best of his knowledge, given the difficult circumstances and time constraints.\n*   **Results Valid:** Despite the acknowledged errors, the FIA maintained that the results of the race and the championship were valid, final, and could not be changed.\n*   **Masi's Removal:** Michael Masi was removed from his position as race director.\n*   **Rule Changes:** The FIA tweaked the sporting regulations for the 2022 season to clarify the safety car un-lapping procedure, replacing \"any\" with \"all\" in the article that now reads: \"All cars that have been lapped by the leader will be required to pass the cars on the lead lap and the Safety Car\". Software was developed to automate the communication of the list of cars that must un-lap themselves.\n"

          "output": "Between the 2019 and 2024 Formula 1 seasons, significant technological advancements and regulation changes have greatly impacted car and team performance. These can be broadly categorized into aerodynamic changes, power unit developments, and financial regulations.\n\n**Aerodynamic Changes:**\n\n*   **Ground Effect (2022):** The reintroduction of ground effect in 2022 was a pivotal shift. This involved designing the car's underbody with venturi tunnels to create a low-pressure area, increasing downforce and cornering speeds. Ground effect allows cars to generate downforce efficiently, enabling higher cornering speeds and improved grip. The goal was to allow cars to follow each other more closely and improve overtaking. The changes included a new front-wing shape and alterations to the rear wing.\n*   **Impact of Ground Effect:** Ground effect led to enhanced cornering and performance, allowing cars to corner at higher speeds. It spurred design innovation, with teams experimenting with underbody configurations. The changes also resulted in drivers experiencing a firmer car setup, described as \"go-kart-like\".\n*   **Regulation evolution:** The FIA is reducing dependence on ground effect principles by mandating that 2026 F1 cars feature partially flat underfloors with much shorter venturi tunnels.\n*   **Aerodynamic Development:** Teams realized that every millimeter of the car's structure could impact performance. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) became a game-changer, allowing teams to simulate airflows in a virtual environment.\n*   **Active Aerodynamics:** Refinements in active aerodynamics also hold significant potential for improving efficiency and performance in consumer vehicles.\n\n**Power Unit Developments:**\n\n*   **V6 Turbo-Hybrid Engines:** Since 2014, F1 cars have used 1.6-liter V6 turbocharged engines with Energy Recovery Systems (ERS). These engines have become more efficient, achieving thermal efficiency rates over 50%. The ERS captures energy from braking (MGU-K) and exhaust gases (MGU-H), providing an additional power boost while reducing CO2 emissions.\n*   **Power Output Increase:** Over the years, engine power has increased from 630 kW (840 hp) to 770 kW (1,030 hp). Future power units in 2026 are expected to produce up to 1,100 bhp (820kW).\n*   **Hybrid Technology:** Hybrid engines, inspired by F1's ERS, are now common in road cars, offering better fuel economy and lower emissions.\n*   **Engine Design and Materials:** Turbochargers have increased power output while maintaining fuel efficiency. Advances in metallurgy and design have allowed for lighter and more durable components.\n*   **2026 Power Unit Regulations:** The MGU-H will be banned, while the MGU-K's output will increase.\n\n**Financial Regulations (Cost Cap):**\n\n*   **Introduction of Cost Cap (2021):** To curb the disparity between teams, F1 introduced a cost cap in 2021. The cap limits the amount teams can spend annually on designing and operating their cars.\n*   **Cost Cap Amounts:** The cost cap was initially set at $145 million for 2021, reduced to $140 million in 2022, and $135 million from 2023 onwards. These figures are adjusted for the number of races in a season.\n*   **Impact of Cost Cap:** The cost cap aims to promote financial sustainability and competitive parity among teams. It has pushed teams to be more resourceful in how they develop their cars.\n*   **Penalties for Breaches:** Penalties for exceeding the cost cap range from financial fines and wind tunnel testing limitations to points deductions and potential disqualification from the championship.\n*   **Engine Cost Cap:** There is also an engine cost cap of $95 million (2022-2025), rising to $130 million from 2026.\n\n**Other Notable Advancements and Regulations:**\n\n*   **Data Analysis:** Teams use data analysis to enhance performance, predict potential failures, and optimize race strategy.\n*   **Materials:** Advances in material science, such as carbon fiber and nanomaterials, have been crucial for creating lighter and stronger cars.\n*   **Halo System:** The Halo system has been improved to offer greater protection, reducing aerodynamic drag while ensuring maximum safety.\n*   **Rear Wing and DRS Regulations (2025):** The FIA has tightened technical regulations surrounding the rear wing and DRS, focusing on defining the state of deployment and limiting deflection.\n*   **Increased Rookie Running (2025):** The mandatory FP1 running for rookie drivers has been expanded, ensuring more track time for inexperienced drivers.\n*   **Weight Limits:** There are different weight limits applied, with an additional 2kg for practice and qualifying sessions, and +5kg for a Sprint or Grand Prix. The minimum weight of F1 cars will decrease to 768 kg in 2026.\n\nThese technological advancements and regulation changes have collectively reshaped the performance and competitive landscape of Formula 1 between 2019 and 2024, with a continued emphasis on sustainability, safety, and closer racing.\n"

Fortnite Bots and AI:**\n\n*   Fortnite bots are AI-driven players designed to help new players learn the game, provide quicker matchmaking, and balance gameplay across skill levels.\n*   Bots have evolved from simple movement and building to constructing intricate structures.\n*   The game intelligently adjusts the number of bots based on a player's skill level.\n\n**2. Keyboard and Bot Interaction:**\n\n*   One search result refers to \"keyboard command circle bot interaction,\" but the context is unclear and doesn't directly relate to Fortnite.\n*   Some players use keyboard and mouse, and Epic Games is exploring options to improve control settings for these players, such as adjusting build and edit sensitivities.\n*   Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) may flag programs that handle keyboard and mouse inputs differently, as these can be associated with cheating or botting.\n\n**3. Keybinds and Settings:**\n\n*   Players can customize their keyboard binds for various actions like movement, building, and combat.\n*   Some players recommend specific keybind setups for beginners or for specific actions like jumping and placing floors simultaneously.\n*   It's possible to adjust settings for individual heroes, including crosshairs and sensitivity.\n\n**4. Cheating and Anti-Cheat Measures:**\n\n*   Epic Games actively combats cheating in Fortnite through legal action and in-game measures.\n*   Cheating can result in matchmaking bans, tournament bans, and potential loss of winnings.\n*   New PC requirements for tournaments may include enabling TPM and Secure Boot to combat cheating.\n*   Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) is used to detect and prevent cheating.\n*   EAC can sometimes cause errors, and troubleshooting steps involve repairing the EAC service or modifying its settings.\n*   Aimbots, which automatically aim weapons at targets, are a popular type of cheat in FPS games.\n\n**5. Bot Lobbies:**\n\n*   Some players seek to get into \"bot lobbies\" to play against less skilled opponents.\n*   One method involves manipulating settings and reporting a bug to trick the game into thinking the player is less skilled.\n\n**6. Controller Issues:**\n\n*   Some players encounter issues with controllers not working properly in-game.\n*   Troubleshooting steps may involve resetting the controller or using a USB connection.\n\n**7. Fortnite Characters and Specialists:**\n\n*   Hirable specialist characters can be given commands for tactical advantages.\n\nIt's important to note that some search results are from earlier dates (e.g., 2019, 2021, 2023, 2024), but they provide context on the evolution of bots, anti-cheat measures, and controller issues in Fortnite. The more recent results (from 2025) offer insights into current keybind strategies, anti-cheat updates, and character locations.\n"

          "output": "Yes, there are alternative keybind options for the command circle (specifically the emote wheel) in Fortnite, and you can customize them on a keyboard. Here's how, along with general information about keybinding in Fortnite:\n\n**Customizing Keybinds**\n\n1.  **Accessing Settings:**\n    *   Load up Fortnite and head to the main menu.\n    *   Press the ESC key or click on the menu icon in the top left corner of the screen.\n    *   Click on the settings icon, click Settings, and navigate to the tab with the directional arrow icon labeled \"Keyboard Controls\".\n\n2.  **Changing Keybinds:**\n    *   In the Keyboard Controls tab, find the specific action you want to rebind (e.g., \"Emote,\" \"Quick Chat Message\").\n    *   Click on the current keybind for that action.\n    *   Press the new key on your keyboard that you want to assign to that action.\n\n3.  **Saving Changes:** Make sure to save your changes in the settings.\n\n**Keybind Considerations and Tips**\n\n*   **Ergonomics and Efficiency:** The best keybinds allow for full directional control at all times, binding every important action to a different finger for the fastest possible inputs.\n*   **WASD Cluster:** Aim to bind every key in a cluster around the WASD keys for movement, with the most critical inputs being the easiest to press.\n*   **Secondary Keybinds:** In the keyboard controls area of settings, you can assign a 2nd keybind to an action.\n*   **Experimentation:**  Experiment and elaborate off recommendations to set a more personalized layout.\n*   **Pros' Setups:** One of the best ways to find keybinds is to tailor your game after the pros.\n\n**Default Emote Key**\n\n*   The default key to open the emote wheel on PC is usually the 'B' key.\n\nBy following these steps, you can customize your keybinds in Fortnite to create a control scheme that works best for you.\n"

They rely on rule-based parsers and regex engines for protocol detection and application identification.\n*   These methods face challenges with the increasing complexity and volume of network data, especially with encrypted traffic. Encryption techniques like TLS 1.3, ESNI, and QUIC hide handshake information and packet header data, making it impossible for traditional DPI tools to identify underlying traffic flows.\n*   Traditional methods also struggle to scale and adapt to evolving encrypted traffic patterns, particularly when payload decryption is not feasible.\n*   Signature and port-based methods are becoming unreliable due to dynamic port allocation and port obfuscation.\n\n**Neural Networks for DPI:**\n\n*   Neural networks offer a novel approach to enhance DPI by leveraging machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and speed of network security analysis.\n*   They can infer session and protocol metadata directly from raw packet sequences, eliminating the need for handcrafted rules and static pattern matching. Deep learning models can replace traditional string matching, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) dynamically learn application signatures, offering greater adaptability.\n*   Machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines, can efficiently analyze packet data. Supervised and unsupervised learning models can adapt and evolve to detect new and emerging threats without relying solely on predefined signatures.\n*   Deep learning models can automatically extract hierarchical features from network traffic, making them suitable for complex classification tasks. CNNs are effective in recognizing spatial feature correlations, while LSTMs are well-suited for analyzing sequential dependencies in time-series network flows.\n*   They can also identify patterns indicative of attacks, allowing for real-time responses to mitigate security risks and prevent network congestion.\n\n**Advantages of Neural Networks:**\n\n*   **Adaptability:** Neural networks can adapt to different domains and applications more easily than classical ML algorithms.\n*   **High Performance:** Deep networks have achieved accuracies far beyond classical ML methods in many domains, including speech, natural language, and vision.\n*   **Feature Extraction:** Deep learning models can automatically extract meaningful features from network traffic, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.\n*   **Handling Encrypted Traffic:** ML models rely on statistical flow-based features, making them effective even when traffic is encrypted.\n*   **Anomaly Detection:** ML algorithms can establish acceptable patterns and detect deviations from the norm, aiding anomaly detection such as spam email recognition and fraud detection.\n*   **Improved Accuracy:** Neural networks can improve the accuracy of predictions, enabling improved data-driven decisions.\n*   **Unstructured Data Analysis:** They can learn from unstructured and unlabeled datasets, enabling the analysis of unstructured data.\n*   **Fault Tolerance:** Neural networks can still function even with incomplete information.\n\n**Disadvantages of Neural Networks:**\n\n*   **Computational Expense:** Neural networks are generally more computationally expensive than traditional algorithms, and training them from scratch can take weeks.\n*   **Large Data Requirements:** They typically require much more data than traditional machine learning algorithms, often needing thousands or millions of labeled samples.\n*   **Black Box Nature:** A significant disadvantage is their \"black box\" nature, making it difficult to understand how and why a neural network arrives at a particular output. This lack of interpretability can be a problem in domains where explainability is critical.\n*   **Complexity:** Neural networks are still alien to many data scientists, requiring time to learn and understand them.\n*   **Inference Time:** For non-trivial problems, large networks can be time-intensive to evaluate at inference time.\n*   **Tooling:** Developing and maintaining tools for neural networks can be challenging, sometimes requiring custom solutions.\n*   **Overfitting:** Neural networks have the potential to overfit if the training rate is too large or not enough learning simulations are conducted.\n\n**Specific Applications and Techniques:**\n\n*   **Encrypted Traffic Classification:** Wavelet transform-based features combined with machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) can effectively classify encrypted traffic, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic.\n*   **RDMA Security:** Machine learning-based deep packet inspection can enhance the security of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) on FPGAs, allowing for the detection of specific content in RDMA payloads at high speeds.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs are used for data augmentation, creating synthetic data for training deep learning models.\n*   **Encrypted Traffic Intelligence (ETI):** Ipoque introduced ETI, which combines ML and DL algorithms with high-dimensional data analysis and advanced caching methods to address the limitations of traditional DPI tools in identifying encrypted traffic flows.\n\n**ТСПУ (Technical Means of Counteracting Threats):**\n\n*   ТСПУ is a set of hardware and software used in Russia to filter internet traffic and block access to certain resources.\n*   Роскомнадзор (RKN) uses ТСПУ to restrict access to prohibited information and resources, including VPNs.\n*   ТСПУ analyzes internet traffic to identify user equipment and can determine a user's access to prohibited sites via their network address.\n*   Operators are required to provide data to RKN to identify user devices, including IP addresses and geographic location, to improve the effectiveness of blocking prohibited content.\n*   RKN is developing methods to track users who bypass блокировки, including those using VPNs.\n*   ТСПУ equipment analyzes the structure, signatures, and sizes of transmitted packets to detect and block connections.\n\n**The Future:**\n\n*   The integration of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into network security offers transformative opportunities for enhancing application identification and traffic classification.\n*   Deep learning is expected to continue improving the accuracy of predictions and enabling the analysis of unstructured data.\n*   Breakthroughs in areas such as capsule networks and deep reinforcement learning are expected to complement deep learning's current limitations.\n\nIn conclusion, while classical methods for DPI face challenges with modern encrypted traffic, neural networks offer promising solutions for enhanced accuracy and adaptability. However, the computational cost, data requirements, and lack of interpretability of neural networks must be considered. The ongoing development of ТСПУ in Russia aims to enhance the effectiveness of блокировки, including those circumvented by VPNs, by collecting detailed user data and analyzing network traffic.\n"

Here's a breakdown of relevant findings:\n\n**1. Neural Networks for Traffic Analysis and Prediction:**\n\n*   **Deep Learning Models:** Research explores the application of deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, and transformer-based models for network traffic analysis, particularly for detecting security breaches in real-time.\n*   **Traffic Parameter Prediction:** Neural networks are used to predict road traffic parameters, control traffic, measure traffic, and analyze driver behavior for autonomous vehicles.\n*   **Traffic Flow Routing and Composition:** Studies use YOLO-based frameworks and neural networks for automated video analysis of traffic flow at intersections.\n*   **Traffic Speed Forecasting:** Enhanced LSTM networks, optimized with algorithms like PSO and GA, are used for traffic speed forecasting using GPS data.\n*   **Network Traffic Protocol Classification:** CNN-LSTM models are employed to improve the classification and prediction of unknown network traffic protocols.\n*   **Traffic Congestion Prediction:** Deep learning architectures like Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Recurrent Neural Networks are used to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on GPS data.\n*   **Darknet Traffic Analysis:** Machine learning and spiking neural networks are used to analyze darknet traffic for cybersecurity purposes.\n\n**2. Acceleration and Hardware Considerations:**\n\n*   **SmartNICs and FPGAs:** One paper introduces Neural Networks on the NIC (N3IC), a system that integrates binary neural network models into SmartNICs for traffic analysis. This approach aims to improve scalability and reduce latency. The paper also presents a design for an FPGA-based prototype to add binary neural network support to a NIC data plane.\n\n**3. Specific Neural Network Architectures and Techniques:**\n\n*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** GNNs are explored as surrogates for agent-based models in transport planning and for traffic forecasting due to their ability to incorporate spatial dependencies.\n*   **LSTM and GRU Networks:** LSTM and GRU networks are frequently used for time series traffic data prediction, capturing long-term dependencies.\n*   **Spatiotemporal Recurrent Convolutional Networks (SRCNs):** SRCNs, combining DCNNs and LSTMs, are used for traffic forecasting in transportation networks.\n\n**4. Case Studies and Datasets:**\n\n*   **Beijing Transportation Network:** One study uses a Beijing transportation network with 278 links to demonstrate the effectiveness of SRCNs.\n*   **Istanbul Traffic Data:** A study uses traffic and weather information from Istanbul to predict traffic patterns with a GRU convolutional neural network model.\n*   **Paris Case Study:** A GNN is trained using MATSim simulation data for a Paris case study with 30,000 nodes to predict the impact of capacity reduction policies on traffic flow.\n*   **CIC-Darknet2020 Dataset:** This dataset is used to evaluate machine learning and deep learning techniques for darknet traffic analysis.\n\n**In summary:** While the term \"TSPU\" isn't explicitly found in the context of these traffic analysis studies, the research strongly indicates the use of neural networks for various traffic-related tasks. The trend towards using specialized hardware like SmartNICs and FPGAs to accelerate these neural networks suggests that TSPUs, or similar tensor processing units, could potentially play a role in future deployments for real-time traffic analysis applications.\n"

Some sources claim a score of 135 or 136 for the same model.\n    *   Other AI models with high IQ scores include Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp (128), OpenAI o4 mini (126), and Claude-4 Opus (119).\n    *   It's worth noting that text-based AI models tend to score higher on IQ tests than multimodal models that process images. For example, GPT-4o (Vision) and Grok-3 Think (Vision) scored significantly lower than the average human IQ.\n*   **Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n    *   **Different Kinds of Intelligence:** IQ tests primarily measure logical-mathematical and spatial intelligence, potentially overlooking other aspects like creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical reasoning.\n    *   **Training Data:** AI models might be trained on the questions or answers used in publicly available IQ tests, which could skew the results.\n    *   **Human vs. AI Intelligence:** AI \"thinking\" differs from human cognition, lacking sentience, consciousness, and the ability to understand intelligence in a meaningful way.\n    *   **The \"Vibe\" of AI IQ:** Some argue that the concept of an AI IQ is misleading because AI skills don't necessarily correlate in the same way human skills do, making it difficult to predict new capabilities based on a single IQ score.\n*   **Alternative Metrics:**\n    *   Researchers are exploring alternative methods to measure AI intelligence, focusing on factors like generalization, skill-acquisition efficiency, and the ability to solve novel problems.\n    *   The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is one such benchmark designed to assess AI's ability to perform tasks never seen before.\n    *   The Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index combines multiple dimensions of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive comparison of AI models.\n*   **The Future of AI and Intelligence Measurement:**\n    *   As AI technology evolves, it's crucial to develop new and more comprehensive methods for evaluating AI capabilities.\n    *   These methods should account for the diverse aspects of intelligence and the unique characteristics of AI systems.\n    *   The goal is to create AI that augments human intelligence and contributes to the common good.\n"

The raters' political or cultural leanings and evaluation criteria can shape a model's output.\n*   **Memorization vs. Reasoning:** AIs can score high on IQ tests due to memorization of the questions if the test is part of the training data. However, when tested on new, unseen questions, they still often outperform humans, suggesting genuine reasoning ability.\n*   **Breadth of Knowledge:** AI models can achieve high IQ scores due to having the entire world's knowledge in their memory, even if they could not solve such questions from scratch.\n\n**Mensa Norway Test Results and Model Performance:**\n\n*   **High Scores:** OpenAI's o3 model has achieved high scores on the Mensa Norway IQ test, with scores of 135 and even 136, placing it in the \"genius\" category. Claude-4 Sonnet (127) and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash (126) also significantly outperform average human intelligence.\n*   **Text-Only vs. Multimodal Models:** Text-only models tend to score higher on IQ tests than multimodal models. For example, GPT-4o (Vision) scored just 63 on the Mensa Norway test. This suggests that AI excels more in verbal reasoning and linguistic tasks than in visual processing.\n*   **Offline vs. Public Tests:** Models tend to score higher on the public Mensa Norway test compared to offline tests designed to avoid training data contamination. For example, OpenAI's o3 scored 136 on the Mensa Norway test but 116 on an offline evaluation.\n*   **Performance on Other Benchmarks:** Besides the Mensa Norway test, AI models are evaluated on various other benchmarks, including AIME, GPQA Diamond, and MMLU.

      "human_message": "how does google's soundstorm ai audio generation work?",
      "ai_message": "Google's SoundStorm is a non-autoregressive audio generation model designed for efficiency and high-quality output [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [analyticsindiamag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). It builds upon the two-step audio generation process of AudioLM, focusing on acoustic modeling by replacing autoregressive decoding with parallel decoding [analyticsindiamag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n*   **Architecture:** SoundStorm uses a bidirectional attention-based Conformer model, combining a Transformer with convolutions to capture both local and global structures in audio data [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [research](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6), [analyticsindiamag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\n*   **Parallel Decoding:** Inspired by MaskGIT, SoundStorm employs a parallel decoding scheme adapted for audio tokens, significantly reducing inference time [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [analyticsindiamag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). This parallel generation of tokens results in a 100-fold reduction in inference time for long sequences [analyticsindiamag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\n*   **Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ):** SoundStorm works with audio tokens from neural audio codecs like SoundStream, which uses RVQ to represent audio at each time step with up to Q tokens [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [analyticsindiamag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3), [research](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6).\n\n*   **Iterative Masking and Prediction:** SoundStorm iteratively fills in masked audio tokens [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). It starts with all tokens masked and predicts them over multiple iterations, refining the audio output [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). At inference, given semantic tokens as input, SoundStorm begins with all audio tokens masked and fills them in iteratively, starting with coarse tokens and proceeding level-by-level to finer tokens [analyticsindiamag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3), [research](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6), [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). Within each RVQ level, multiple iterations are performed to gradually estimate the masked portions until all tokens are estimated [openreview](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n\n*   **Training:** A masking scheme is used during training to mimic the iterative inference process [research](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6), [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3), [research](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1). An RVQ level *q* is sampled, and a subset of tokens at that level are masked, along with all tokens at finer levels (*q*+1 to *Q*) [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). The loss is computed only on the masked tokens at level *q* [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). SoundStorm also uses a cosine masking schedule [openreview](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n\n*   **Confidence-Based Iterative Sampling:** SoundStorm employs confidence-based parallel decoding to sample the tokens of a neural audio codec [openreview](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). For each iteration, masks are obtained using a masking schedule (cosine schedule) combined with confidence scores [openreview](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n\nSoundStorm generates audio much faster than autoregressive models [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5), achieving a two-order-of-magnitude speed-up compared to autoregressive modeling [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). It maintains high audio quality [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) and demonstrates improved consistency in speaker identity and acoustic conditions [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [analyticsvidhya](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4), resulting in more realistic and seamless audio output [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). SoundStorm leverages the conditional independence assumption inherent in the hierarchical structure of RVQ, where finer levels capture information not yet captured by coarser levels [substack](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5].",

Managed servers are more expensive, sometimes by as much as 50%, because the hosting provider handles server setup, maintenance, security, updates, and support [1gbits](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [monovm](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1). Unmanaged servers can start as low as $5 to $15 per month, while managed servers often start around $30 to $70 per month [monovm](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1).\n\n**V. Power Consumption Considerations**\n\n*   **Workload Scenarios:** High core count servers are more efficient for multi-threaded/multi-user workloads [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-7). High clock speed servers are better suited for single-threaded applications and tasks that function in a linear fashion [winnervps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-3).\n*   **CPU Utilization and Idle Time:** Server energy consumption varies depending on utilization [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-10). All servers have idle cycles, which consume energy without producing results [iea-4e](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-11).\n*   **Power Consumption Factors:** More efficient power supply units play a role in total power consumption [iea-4e](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-8). Traditional air-cooling methods are reaching their limits, leading to the rise of liquid cooling [iea-4e](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-8).\n\n**VI. AMD vs. Intel (2025)**\n\n*   **Core Count:** AMD EPYC processors generally offer higher core counts than Intel Xeon processors [kingservers](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6).\n*   **Performance:** AMD EPYC is strong in virtualization, while Intel is good for niche accelerated workloads [kingservers](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6).\n*   **Energy Efficiency:** AMD EPYC processors tend to offer better performance per watt [exertisenterprise](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4) [1gbits](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-13).\n*   **Cost:** AMD has traditionally offered more cores for the money, but Intel is becoming more competitive [kingservers](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6) [1gbits](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-13).\n\nUltimately, the best choice depends on your specific needs, technical expertise, and budget.",

These policies, coupled with Zhongke Shuguang's placement on the US Entity List, create significant headwinds for the company [fakti](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-8) [thompsonhinesmartrade](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0). The US government views Sugon as being involved in China's development of advanced computing capabilities for military applications, making it a key target of export controls [thompsonhinesmartrade](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [federalregister](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n\n**Specific Technologies and Products Affected:**\n\nUS export controls and tariffs significantly impact Sugon's access to key technologies, particularly in:\n\n*   **High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Supercomputers:** Sugon's involvement in developing exascale high-performance computing makes it a target, as the US aims to limit China's advanced computing capabilities [thompsonhinesmartrade](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [federalregister](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [bis](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2).\n*   **Semiconductors and Related Manufacturing Equipment:** Restrictions on access to advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing items hinder Sugon's ability to design and manufacture high-end devices [federalregister](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [csis](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3). Suppliers are reportedly unable to source US chips for Sugon due to sanctions [asiatimes](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4).\n*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technologies:** Intensified export control regulations on advanced AI technologies, especially those with high strategic value, limit Sugon's access to chips needed for AI model training and advanced applications [zpcsrl](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6) [semianalysis](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7).\n\n**Potential Impact on Stock Price:**\n\nGiven these factors, the US tariff policies and export controls are likely to exert downward pressure on Zhongke Shuguang's stock price. Here's why:\n\n*   **Reduced Access to Key Technologies:** The inability to source advanced chips and manufacturing equipment from the US will likely hinder Sugon's ability to compete in the high-performance computing and AI markets [asiatimes](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4) [federalregister](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n*   **Increased Costs:** Tariffs on imported components and equipment will likely increase production costs, potentially impacting profit margins.\n*   **Uncertainty and Volatility:** The fluctuating nature of US-China trade relations and the potential for further restrictions create uncertainty, which can negatively affect investor sentiment [techtarget](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [avalara](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).\n*   **Sluggish Profit Forecast:** One source indicated that Zhongke Shuguang's profit was forecast to be sluggish in the first half of the fiscal year due to the impact of U.S. trade policy [storage-yahoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8).\n\n**Market Reaction to Tariff Changes:**\n\nThe market's reaction to tariff announcements demonstrates its sensitivity to trade tensions [fool](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8). The \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in April 2025 led to a global market crash [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0), while the temporary tariff reduction in May 2025 sparked a market rally [jpmorgan](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-2). However, even with the temporary reduction, the effective tariff rate on most Chinese goods remained above 30% [china-briefing](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6).\n\n**Mitigating Strategies:**\n\nZhongke Shuguang may implement several strategies to mitigate the impact of US tariffs:\n\n*   **Focus on Domestic Market:** Prioritizing domestic consumption and increasing domestic sales [idc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0).\n*   **Increase R&D and Self-Reliance:** Strengthening self-research capabilities and increasing R&D investment in localization [webull](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-4).\n*   **Product and Service Diversification:** Enriching product types and increasing the proportion of service revenue with high added value [webull](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-4).\n*   **Mergers and Acquisitions:** Absorption and merger with Haiguang Information to gather core strengths to jointly invest in high-end chip and solution research and development [webull](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-4).\n*   **Supply Chain Diversification:** Exploring manufacturing options in countries such as India, Vietnam, and Malaysia [techtarget](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-2).\n\n**Financial Estimates:**\n\nAn analyst estimated Zhongke Shuguang's net profit for 2025 to be 2.846 billion yuan, with an EPS of 1.94 yuan/share [futunn](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6). Revenue for Q2 2025 is estimated at 3.40B CNY, a 5.06% year-over-year increase [moomoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe US tariff policies and export controls pose significant challenges for Zhongke Shuguang. While the company may implement mitigating strategies, the restrictions on access to key technologies and increased costs are likely to negatively impact its stock price. The extent of the impact will depend on the effectiveness of Sugon's mitigation efforts, the evolution of US-China trade relations, and overall market conditions.",

Vous devrez probablement l'optimiser pour la performance (e.g., requêtes API en parallèle, gestion efficace des transactions en attente).\n*   **Frais:** Tenez compte des frais de transaction sur Solana.\n*   **Slippage:** Surveillez et gérez le slippage pour éviter les mauvaises surprises lors des swaps.\n*   **Risques:** Le trading de tokens récents est très risqué. Soyez conscient des risques de \"rug pull\" et de volatilité extrême.\n\n**Monitoring et Tracking**\n\nPour le monitoring et le tracking, vous pouvez envisager les éléments suivants :\n\n*   **Journalisation:** Enregistrez toutes les actions du bot (achats, ventes, erreurs) dans un fichier journal.\n*   **Métriques:** Suivez des métriques clés telles que le nombre de transactions, le volume échangé, les profits/pertes, etc.\n*   **Alertes:** Configurez des alertes pour les événements importants (e.g., erreurs critiques, seuils de profit/perte atteints).\n\nhttps://betastation.jup.ag/docs/apis/swap-api\nConstruction script swap filter time automatique usage order: \n-Ask user private key \n-Extrait informations temps réel \n-Si createdAt moins de 20 secondes comparaison avec Current time \n        -buy 0.0001 SOL vers .baseHash\n        -Wait 3 min\n        -100% des tokens de .baseHash vers SOL\nSi T'arrive à faire se script swap dans les 2 sens avec succès \n\nUtilisation de l'API swap Jupiter et ceci :\n\nUn trading bot qui est basé sur le temp. Par exemple j'utilise des réponses JSON d'une liste de token. Je veux faire des achats ventes baser sur des filtres de temp . Par exemple le token a été créé il y a 3 secondes, le bot déterminé que c'est moins de 20 secondes, achete 0.0001 sol , l'achat est un succès, attend que le temps du token soit créé il y a 3 min pour le revendre a 100% . Il faudrait le bot puissent gérer le temp et plusieurs transaction en même temp. Par exemple après l'achat, programmer la revente sur la date de création quand il y aura marqué 3 minutes dans la liste JSON Sur la ligne du token acheter. Je sais c'est compliqué mais peus tu m'aider a juste établir une idée sans base donné et super léger avec Raydium. Sans code juste un tableau.\nÉcrire la logique pour l'extraction des valeurs> le management des transactions > l'achat et vente de token .> le monitoring, le tracking et plus encore...\n\n\nExample response curl https://api.coinscan.com/v2/pair-explorer/1399811149/age/24h/0/675kPX9MHTjS2zt\n###\n{\"version\":\"1.0\",\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"pages\":252,\"rows\":[{\"chain\":1399811149,\"pairHash\":\"EJ1bLzbxccJ8rU5x6xsWuwqeyrTbFaMkTeC6pAEo37xr\",\"baseHash\":\"AoX8aStPZU9hNezN2ihN7wdVF7s68X5R8gYxAsBiveJ\",\"baseSymbol\":\"TT2\",\"baseName\":\"TEST TOKEN2\",\"baseIconTs\":0,\"socials\":{},\"verified\":null,\"quoteHash\":\"So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112\",\"quoteSymbol\":\"SOL\",\"quoteName\":\"Wrapped SOL\",\"quoteIconTs\":1734181811,\"dexHash\":\"CPMMoo8L3F4NbTegBCKVNunggL7H1ZpdTHKxQB5qKP1C\",\"dexName\":\"Raydium\",\"dexLabel\":\"CPMM\",\"dexIconTs\":1722382249,\"price\":\"0.000000002252268727195849094\",\"createdAt\":1744297535,\"discoveredAt\":0,\"liquidity\":\"3.3826384359430846684\",\"marketCap\":\"2.252268727195842337193818412452718\",\"fdMarketCap\":\"2.252268727195849094\",\"volume\":\"1.1190660116597665633\",\"transactions\":1,\"makers\":1,\"pc5m\":0,\"pc1h\":0,\"pc6h\":0,\"pc24h\":0},{\"chain\":1399811149,\"pairHash\":\"qfF5GxFB7YiWnppE6UTyZyotMRKXPx1CsXKb2zDZYAk\",\"baseHash\":\"D7zBrprrA2y4xEiBzkuTiiVsVqZekJgwSd7bKpwnwjSE\",\"baseSymbol\":\"MASTERS\",\"baseName\":\"The Masters\",\"baseIconTs\":1744293903,\"socials\":{\"twitter\":\"https://x.com/TheMasters\"},\"verified\":null,\"quoteHash\":\"So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112\",\"quoteSymbol\":\"SOL\",\"quoteName\":\"Wrapped SOL\",\"quoteIconTs\":1734181811,\"dexHash\":\"CPMMoo8L3F4NbTegBCKVNunggL7H1ZpdTHKxQB5qKP1C\",\"dexName\":\"Raydium\",\"dexLabel\":\"CPMM\",\"dexIconTs\":1722382249,\"price\":\"0.000000013179898481776899803\",\"createdAt\":1744294387,\"discoveredAt\":0,\"liquidity\":\"0.0019111530303040683347\",\"marketCap\":\"13.171365093061995398254926766180973\",\"fdMarketCap\":\"13.171365093061995398254926766180973\",\"volume\":\"0\",\"transactions\":0,\"makers\":0,\"pc5m\":0,\"pc1h\":-21.16291846660421,\"pc6h\":-4.293428688590264,\"pc24h\":-4.293428688590264}, and more until ]}}\n###\nNe pas dévier, ni mentir , ni superflue, suivre uniquement mes directives .

      "ai_message": "Okay, here's a comprehensive guide to building a time-based trading bot using the Jupiter Swap API and Raydium, focusing on logic, extraction, transaction management, and monitoring, all while adhering to your directives. This design prioritizes automation and minimal human intervention.\n\n**I. Core Logic and Workflow**\n\nThe bot will operate on a continuous loop, performing the following steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   **Securely Acquire Private Key:**  The bot *must* obtain the user's Solana private key.  **Security is paramount.** Never store the key in plain text. Employ a robust secret manager or encryption method. Consider using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves for enhanced protection [wundertrading](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-2) [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-3) [helius](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-5).\n2.  **Data Extraction (Coinscan API):**\n    *   **Fetch Recent Tokens:** Query the Coinscan API to retrieve a list of recently created tokens. You'll need the Coinscan API URL. Use `curl` or an HTTP library to make the request.\n    *   **Parse JSON Response:** Extract relevant information from the JSON response. Specifically, you'll need `createdAt` (Unix timestamp) and `baseHash` for each token.  Based on the example JSON, extract `createdAt` using `data.rows[i].createdAt` and `baseHash` using `data.rows[i].baseHash` (where `i` is the index of the token).\n    *   **API Error Handling:** Implement error handling for the Coinscan API (e.g., rate limits, network issues).\n3.  **Time-Based Filtering:**\n    *   **Calculate Token Age:** For each token, calculate its age in seconds: `current_time` (Unix timestamp) - `createdAt` (Unix timestamp).\n    *   **Age Threshold:** Check if the token's age is less than 20 seconds.\n4.  **Purchase (Conditional):**\n    *   **Criteria:** If the token's age is less than 20 seconds, proceed with the purchase.\n    *   **Purchase Order:** Create a buy order for 0.0001 SOL worth of the token (identified by its `baseHash`). Use the Jupiter Swap API for this.\n    *   **Transaction Signing:** Sign the transaction using the user's private key.\n    *   **Transaction Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for transaction failures (e.g., slippage, insufficient funds).  Common Jupiter API errors include exceeding slippage tolerance (error code 6001, `0x1771`) [jup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0) [jup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-1) [quicknode](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-2).\n5.  **Sale Scheduling:**\n    *   **Target Sale Time:** Calculate the target Unix timestamp for selling: `createdAt` + 3 minutes (180 seconds).\n    *   **Pending Transaction Storage:** Store the transaction information (e.g., `baseHash`, quantity purchased, target sale timestamp) in a pending transaction list.  Use an appropriate data structure (e.g., a dictionary or a custom class).\n6.  **Monitoring and Sale Execution:**\n    *   **Loop:** Continuously iterate through the pending transaction list (e.g., every second).\n    *   **Time Check:** For each pending transaction, check if `current_time` is greater than or equal to the target sale timestamp.\n    *   **Sale Order:** If the target time has arrived, create a sell order to sell 100% of the acquired tokens back to SOL. Use the Jupiter Swap API.\n    *   **Transaction Signing:** Sign the transaction with the user's private key.\n    *   **Transaction Error Handling:** Handle potential transaction errors.\n    *   **Remove from List:** Remove the completed transaction from the pending transaction list.\n7.  **Error Management:**\n    *   **Exception Handling:** Implement comprehensive exception handling to catch API errors, transaction failures, network issues, and other potential problems.\n    *   **Logging:** Implement robust logging to track all bot actions, errors, and relevant data for debugging and analysis.\n    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors.\n\n**II. Extraction of Values**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, based on the example JSON response:\n\n*   `createdAt`: `data.rows[i].createdAt`\n*   `baseHash`: `data.rows[i].baseHash`\n\n**III. Transaction Management**\n\n*   **Pending Transaction List:** Use a data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries or custom objects) to store pending transactions. Each entry should include:\n    *   `baseHash`: The token's base hash.\n    *   `quantity`: The amount of the token purchased.\n    *   `purchase_time`: The `createdAt` timestamp of the token.\n    *   `sale_time`: The target sale timestamp (`createdAt` + 3 minutes).\n*   **Concurrency:**  Implement asynchronous operations to handle multiple API requests concurrently [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4). Use a queueing system to manage and prioritize transactions, preventing overload [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4).\n\n**IV. Buying and Selling Tokens**\n\n*   **Jupiter Swap API:** Utilize the Jupiter Swap API for both buying and selling. Refer to the Jupiter API documentation [quicknode](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [jup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n    *   **/v6/quote:**  Fetch a quote for the swap [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). Required parameters include `inputMint` (token to swap from), `outputMint` (token to swap to), `amount`, and `slippageBps` [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6).\n    *   **/v6/swap-instructions:** Returns swap instructions [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5]. It requires the quote from the previous step, the user's public key, and optional parameters like `dynamicComputeUnitLimit` [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n    *   **/swap:**  This endpoint can be used to get a transaction to submit on-chain [quicknode](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n*   **Slippage:**  Monitor and manage slippage. Consider using dynamic slippage calculation [quicknode](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-2).\n*   **Prioritization Fee:**  Increase the priority fee (`prioritizationFeeLamports`) to outbid others during high congestion [jup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0). Setting it to \"auto\" uses 2x of the 75th percentile of recent prioritization fees [jup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0). You can also use `{\"autoMultiplier\": 2}` to double the auto fees [jup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0).\n\n**V. Monitoring and Tracking**\n\n*   **Logging:** Log all bot actions (purchases, sales, errors) to a file.\n*   **Metrics:** Track key metrics:\n    *   Number of transactions\n    *   Volume traded\n    *   Profits/losses\n    *   Error rates\n*   **Alerts:** Configure alerts for critical events (e.g., critical errors, profit/loss thresholds).  Consider using Telegram or Discord alerts [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\n**VI. Additional Considerations**\n\n*   **Raydium Integration:** While the core logic uses Jupiter for swaps, you can potentially use the Raydium API for fetching pool information or for direct swaps if desired.  However, the Raydium API is not suitable for real-time tracking [raydium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0).\n*   **Rate Limits:** Be mindful of API rate limits for both Coinscan and Jupiter. Implement appropriate delays and error handling to avoid exceeding these limits. Consider upgrading to a higher tier if you consistently hit rate limits [jup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n*   **Security:**  Reiterate the importance of private key security.  Use restricted API keys that can trade on your behalf but never withdraw funds [gunbot](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-1]. Regularly rotate API keys and use unique keys for different services [alwin](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-7).\n*   **Infrastructure:** Use fast infrastructure and private RPC nodes to minimize latency [rpcfast](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7).\n*   **MEV Protection:** Consider implementing MEV protection strategies [99bitcoins](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [mevx](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6).\n*   **API Updates:** Be aware that Price API V2 and Token API V1 are deprecated as of June 2025 and will be fully deprecated by August 1, 2025. Migrate to V3 and V2 respectively [jup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1).\n\nThis detailed logic provides a solid foundation for your automated time-based trading bot.

      "human_message": "For a level 5 EM, would BB do more dmg than attacking twice? Due to the extra attack gained at level 5",
      "ai_message": "To determine whether a level 5 EM attack would do more damage than attacking twice, several factors need to be considered, and the answer is highly dependent on the specific game system in question. Here's a breakdown of the relevant considerations based on the provided summaries:\n\n**1. Game System Context:**\n\n*   The original question refers to \"level 5 EM,\" which could stand for Electro-Magnetic. Different games handle elemental damage, critical hits, and multiple attacks in unique ways. The summaries mention D&D 5e, Warframe, and Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) as potential contexts.\n\n**2. D&D 5e:**\n\n*   At level 5, characters in D&D 5e gain increased damage output through class features, spells, and feats [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1].\n*   Damage calculation involves rolling dice and adding modifiers [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0). Critical hits double the damage dice, and modifiers are added as normal [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n*   If the \"EM\" attack is a spell or ability that deals damage, compare its damage dice + modifiers to the damage of two regular attacks (including potential modifiers and the possibility of critical hits).\n*   Two-Weapon Fighting rules may apply if the \"attacking twice\" involves dual wielding [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2].\n\n**3. Warframe:**\n\n*   Elemental mods add damage as a percentage of the weapon's base damage [1v9](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0).\n*   Enemies have vulnerabilities and resistances that depend on their faction [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [warframe](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n*   Critical hits are indicated by yellow numbers, with orange and red indicating \"super critical\" hits when the weapon has a critical chance greater than 100% [fanbyte](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n*   Every damage type has a status effect that has a percentage chance to activate [fanbyte](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n*   In Warframe, consider the base damage of the weapon, the added elemental damage from \"EM,\" enemy resistances/vulnerabilities to Magnetic damage (which is effective against Corpus units [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5)), critical hit chance, and the potential for status effects. Compare this to the damage of two attacks with the same weapon, considering their critical hit chances and status effects.\n\n**4. Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ):**\n\n*   There are five elements: Fire, Electric, Ice, Physical, and Ether [charlieintel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5) [gfinityesports](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6).\n*   Enemies have weaknesses and resistances to different elements [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7) [charlieintel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5].\n*   Continuously dealing elemental damage builds up Attribute Anomaly, applying a debuff [charlieintel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5) [gfinityesports](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6].\n*   Damage calculation involves stats like ATK, DMG Multiplier, CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG, DMG Boosts, Vulnerability, and Resistance Reduction [hoyolab](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-8).\n*   In ZZZ, the comparison would involve calculating the damage of the \"EM\" attack (considering the character's stats, enemy weaknesses/resistances to Electric damage, and the potential for Attribute Anomaly) versus the damage of two regular attacks.\n\n**5. Elemental vs. Raw Damage (General):**\n\n*   Raw damage and elemental damage scale differently [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4).\n*   Elemental damage often has a consistent modifier, but its effectiveness is influenced by monster hit zones, sharpness, and attack buffs [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4).\n*   Elemental damage may not benefit from critical hits in some games [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4].\n*   Consider monster weaknesses and resistances when choosing between raw and elemental damage [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4].\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithout knowing the specific game system, it's impossible to definitively say whether a level 5 EM attack would do more damage than attacking twice. The answer depends on the game's damage calculation formulas, the character's stats, enemy weaknesses/resistances, critical hit mechanics, and any status effects associated with the attacks. You need to calculate the expected damage output of each option within the rules of the game you are playing.",

      "ai_message": "As of July 16, 2025, research funding is experiencing a complex and dynamic landscape, shaped by both promising opportunities and significant challenges.\n\n**General Trends and Key Areas of Focus:**\n\nGlobally, there's an increasing emphasis on funding research related to sustainability, climate change, equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), and interdisciplinary collaboration [cayuse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0). The integration of data science to improve access to and use of biomedical and behavioral data is also a priority [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). Efficiency in R&D, reduced medicine development times, and increased probabilities of success are being emphasized [iqvia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). Public-private partnerships are being fostered to accelerate innovation [cayuse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n\n**Specific Funding Initiatives:**\n\n*   **Biopharma:** Biopharma R&D funding has increased, reaching a 10-year high of $102 billion in 2024 [iqvia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [iqvia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n*   **Horizon Europe:** Horizon Europe will invest €7.3 billion in 2025, focusing on green and digital transitions [eua](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6).\n*   **Canada:** The Canadian government is providing over $1.3 billion to support researchers and projects [canada](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7).\n*   **Foundations:** Foundations like Kauffman, Merck, William T. Grant, and Leakey are focusing on areas such as equitable economic mobility, biomanufacturing, inequality reduction, and human origins, respectively [kauffman](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8) [merckgroup](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9) [wtgrantfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10) [leakeyfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-11).\n\n**Challenges and Concerns, Particularly in the US:**\n\nFederal funding cuts are reshaping research across the U.S., causing delayed grants, hiring freezes, and overall uncertainty [biorender](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-12) [universityofcalifornia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-13) [forbes](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-14). Policy changes introduced by the Trump administration in early 2025, including funding freezes and restrictions on indirect costs, have exacerbated these issues [atomgrants](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-15). Proposed budget cuts for Fiscal Year 2026 include significant reductions for the CDC, NASA, and NIH [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Over $1.5 billion in federal grant money has been terminated, with STEM education grants accounting for a significant portion [nea](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4). Restrictions have also been placed on research topics related to climate change, DEI, and international collaborations [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [atomgrants](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). These cuts are projected to have long-term consequences, including economic decline, stalled breakthroughs, and a loss of global scientific leadership [aau](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7) [american](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8) [insightintoacademia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4).\n\n**UK's Approach to Long-Term Funding:**\n\nIn contrast, the UK government is introducing criteria to support long-term, ten-year funding for R&D activities, aiming to provide certainty and attract private investment [www](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3) [openaccessgovernment](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [www](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). These criteria focus on infrastructure, talent, international collaboration, and partnerships with businesses [openaccessgovernment](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [research-live](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2).\n\n**Strategies for Researchers:**\n\nGiven these trends, researchers are diversifying funding sources, adapting to new priorities, and emphasizing collaboration [biorender](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-12) [cayuse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).

      "ai_message": "Determining the \"most powerful\" weapon in *S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl* before the \"point of no return\" depends on your play style and what you consider \"powerful\" (damage, accuracy, rate of fire, etc.). However, here's a breakdown of some top contenders across different weapon types, considering their stats and ease of acquisition:\n\n**For a good all-around weapon:**\n\n*   **AKM-74S:** This assault rifle is a solid early-game choice due to its wide availability, common ammo, manageable recoil, and decent accuracy for medium to long-range combat [driffle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). A unique variant, \"Valik Lummox's AKM74s\" with an extended magazine and scope, can be found during the \"Warlock's Debtor\" side mission [gamepressure](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [pcgamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). The \"Drowned\" AKM-74S is also considered a top variant and can be found near the Slag Heap [screenrant](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n\n**For accuracy:**\n\n*   **GP37:** This German-made rifle is known as the most accurate in the game, featuring a standard scope [driffle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Find it in the Plant Boiler Station area of the Garbage region [driffle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n\n**For close-quarters combat:**\n\n*   **Viper-5:** This SMG is effective in medium and short-range engagements due to its high rate of fire and large magazine [gamesradar](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). You can find it soon after clearing the prologue [gamesradar](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). \"Shah's Mate,\" a powerful variant of the Viper-5, can be acquired during the \"No Honor Among Thieves\" side quest [driffle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n\n**For Shotgun enthusiasts:**\n\n*   **Texan:** This shotgun has some of the highest damage and rate of fire among all shotguns, making it a perfect choice for any adventurer [gamerant](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7). It can be found by visiting one of the Abandoned Science Campus pods in the southeast area of the Jupiter region [gamerant](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7).\n\n**For long-range engagements:**\n\n*   **SVDM-2:** This sniper rifle offers high damage, penetration, and accuracy [indiatodaygaming](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). It can be looted from Leshy, a bandit leader at the abandoned factory, North-East of Zalissya [indiatodaygaming](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n*   **M71 Super:** The M71 Super can one-shot the harder exoskeleton enemies in the head on veteran difficulty [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-9).\n\n**For raw power (but potentially later acquisition):**\n\n*   **Gauss Gun:** This weapon boasts excellent damage and can eliminate tough enemies [gamerant](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7). It's obtained by completing the \"In the Name of Science\" side mission [gamerant](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7).\n\n**Pistols**\n\n*   **Rhino:** Considered one of the best pistols, the Rhino is a hard-hitting hunting revolver with the highest damage of any other pistol in the game [driffle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). It uses AR ammunition and has a high penetration rating [driffle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Find it on a body in the middle of Yantar [driffle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Ammo:** Always consider the availability of ammunition [gamesradar](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n*   **Condition:** Be prepared to repair looted weapons [gamesradar](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). Technicians can repair weapons [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-13].\n*   **Customization:** Utilize attachments and upgrades to enhance your chosen weapon [deltiasgaming](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-10) [rockpapershotgun](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10) [mapgenie](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8).\n\nUltimately, the \"most powerful\" weapon is subjective and depends on your play style and the specific situation.

Kaoru and Ritsuko exchange letters, but they eventually become less frequent because a man told Kaoru to stop contacting her [gamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). They later reunite at Sachiko's wedding, where Ritsuko clarifies that the man acted on his own and that she is still single [gamer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).

      "ai_message": "As of July 16, 2025, determining whether $70/TB/mo is a good price for an S3-like online data storage service for computer vision model training requires considering several factors. Most cloud storage providers, like Amazon S3, use a pay-as-you-go model [cloudzero](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [amazon](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), and costs are influenced by storage pricing, request and data retrieval pricing, data transfer pricing, data management feature pricing, and replication pricing [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [amazon](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [cloudchipr](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\n**Amazon S3 Pricing:**\n\n*   S3 Standard costs $0.023 per GB per month for the first 50 TB in the US East (N. Virginia) region [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). This equates to $23.55/TB/month.\n*   S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (IA) starts at $0.0125 per GB, or $12.80/TB/month [cloudchipr](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3), [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n*   S3 Glacier Deep Archive costs $0.00099/GB per month, or $1.01/TB/month [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5), but has retrieval costs and delays [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n\n**Alternatives to S3:**\n\n*   **Google Cloud Storage:** Standard is $0.023 per GB/month ($23.55/TB/month), Nearline is $0.015 per GB/month ($15.36/TB/month), Coldline is $0.007 per GB/month ($7.17/TB/month), and Archive Storage is $0.004 per GB/month ($4.10/TB/month) [codersdaily](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7).\n*   **DigitalOcean Spaces:** Starts at $5 per month for 250 GB and 1 TB outbound data transfer; additional storage is $0.02 per GB ($20.48/TB/month) [cloudzero](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [codersdaily](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7).\n*   **Backblaze B2:** Charges $0.005/GB/month ($5.12/TB/month) for storage and $0.001/GB/month for data downloads [cloudzero](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [digitalocean](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8).\n*   **Wasabi:** Offers a single storage tier and eliminates data egress fees [digitalocean](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8), [cloudzero](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n*   **IBM Cloud Object Storage:** Offers a One-Rate Plan with flat-rate pricing [cloudzero](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [ibm](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10). They were offering up to 70% off promotional pricing for IBM Cloud Object Storage's One-Rate Plan, starting July 1 through September 30, 2025 [ibm](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).\n\n**Is $70/TB/mo a good price?**\n\nBased on the above, $70/TB/mo is significantly higher than the standard rates for most S3-like storage options. S3 Standard, Google Cloud Storage Standard, DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze B2, and potentially IBM Cloud Object Storage (with promotional pricing) all offer substantially lower prices [cloudzero](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [digitalocean](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8), [ibm](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10), [codersdaily](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7), [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). The suitability of a storage class also depends on access frequency [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). If the data is infrequently accessed, options like S3 IA, Google Cloud Nearline/Coldline/Archive, or Backblaze B2 might be more cost-effective [cloudchipr](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3), [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [codersdaily](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7), [cloudzero](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [digitalocean](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8).\n\n**W&B Data Storage Pricing:**\n\n*   W&B includes 100 GB of free storage [saasworthy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n*   Additional cloud storage can be purchased for $0.03 per GB, billed monthly [wandb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7), [wandb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4). This equates to $30.72/TB/month.\n\nTherefore, $70/TB/mo is not a good price compared to both standard cloud storage options and W&B's additional storage pricing [cloudzero](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0), [digitalocean](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8), [ibm](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10), [codersdaily](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7), [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [wandb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7), [wandb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4), [saasworthy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n\nIt's crucial to evaluate your specific storage needs, access patterns, and data transfer requirements to accurately estimate costs and choose the most suitable and cost-effective option [nops](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [cloudchipr](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3), [amazon](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).",

Tools like AnkiConnect expose Anki's functionality through a REST API, allowing external applications (like your AI agent) to create, modify, and manage flashcards [lobehub](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-9].\n*   **Existing Tools Validate the Idea:** Several add-ons already integrate AI into Anki, such as MnemoMaker, which creates flashcards with AI-powered mnemonics [ankiweb](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2), and Anki AI Utils, which explains difficult concepts and illustrates ideas using AI-generated images [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3].\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n*   **Accuracy is Key:** Ensuring the accuracy of AI-generated content is crucial, especially for factual subjects [nih](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0]. You'll need to implement quality control measures and potentially incorporate human oversight.\n*   **Personalization Beyond Mnemonics:** While mnemonics are a great starting point, consider how the agent could personalize other aspects of the learning experience, such as adjusting review schedules or recommending additional resources [medankigen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6) [turinq](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0].\n*   **User Feedback:** Build in mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the generated mnemonics. This will help the AI agent learn and improve over time [tdcommons](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2].\n*   **Ethical Considerations:** Be mindful of data privacy and potential biases in the AI models you use [pressbooks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-2].\n\n**Is it \"too narrow\" or achievable without an agent?**\n\nWhile some basic mnemonic generation might be possible without a full-fledged AI agent, the real value comes from the agent's ability to:\n\n*   **Learn User Preferences:** An agent can continuously learn what types of mnemonics work best for a specific user.\n*   **Adapt to Knowledge Gaps:** The agent can identify and address individual knowledge gaps, tailoring mnemonics to specific areas of weakness [ubos](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-11).\n*   **Automate the Process:** An agent can automate the entire process of identifying difficult cards, generating mnemonics, and updating the Anki deck.\n\nTherefore, while a simple script might generate basic mnemonics, an AI agent can provide a much more personalized and effective learning experience.\n\nIn conclusion, your idea is timely and aligns with current trends in AI-powered personalized learning. By focusing on accuracy, personalization, and ethical considerations, you can create a valuable tool for Anki users.",

      "ai_message": "Okay, here's a story incorporating the tips for writing a compelling short story, as of today, July 16, 2025:\n\nThe old lighthouse keeper, Silas, squinted at the churning grey sea. A storm was brewing, mirroring the tempest in his own heart. His life had been disrupted early, years ago, when his wife, Elara, vanished without a trace during a similar squall [spines](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5). Now, a new threat loomed: the lighthouse's lamp, his sole purpose, flickered erratically. This was the inciting incident, the disturbance [spines](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), [ryanlanz](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8).\n\nSilas was a relatable character, driven by a clear goal: to keep the light burning, a beacon of hope and a testament to Elara's memory [spines](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5), [spines](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). He was complex, a man hardened by loss but softened by the rhythmic pulse of the sea. His internal conflict raged: could he face another storm, another potential loss [ryanlanz](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8)?\n\nHe climbed the winding stairs, the salt-laced wind howling like a banshee. The air tasted of brine and fear [ryanlanz](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8). \"Damn this storm,\" he muttered, his voice raspy, a tight line of dialogue conveying his desperation [spines](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). He only spoke when necessary.\n\nReaching the lamp room, he saw the problem: a fractured lens, spiderweb cracks distorting the beam. This was the central conflict, the obstacle he had to overcome [ryanlanz](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8), [commonwealthfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9). He had to act fast.\n\nUsing his knowledge, Silas worked feverishly, his movements precise despite his age. He replaced the lens with a spare, his heart pounding against his ribs. The light sputtered, then blazed, cutting through the darkness. Tension remained high throughout the story [cbc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6).\n\nAs dawn broke, the storm subsided. Silas stood watch, the beam a steady guide. He hadn't just saved ships; he'd reaffirmed his commitment to Elara's memory. The resolution was organic, born from the narrative [commonwealthfoundation](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9). The light still shone, a symbol of resilience against the relentless sea, and a testament to the enduring power of love and loss. He found his point [jamesvanpelt](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).\n\nThis short story, aiming for a word count between 1,500 and 5,000 words [queenoftreasures](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3), focuses on a single main character, one main conflict, and a limited timeframe [annerallen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4). It follows a traditional narrative arc, with exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution [spines](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).",

It emphasizes the opposition between the expressed content and the speaker's true thought or perception [lawnet](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6). In spoken language, intonation, facial expressions, and gestures often accompany \"nói mỉa\" [dokumen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2]. For example, the phrase \"Giỏi thật đấy!\" (You're really good!) can be used sarcastically to mock someone's mistake [free](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-9]. Irony in Vietnamese literature serves as a method of critique and a strategy for survival [escholarship](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1), often used to critique societal flaws [vinwonders](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2]. It relies on the audience understanding that the speaker's intent differs from the literal meaning of the words [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7].\n\n**Nghịch ngữ (Paradox/Juxtaposition):**\n\n\"Nghịch ngữ\" is a statement that appears self-contradictory but contains a deeper truth [wordpress](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5), [quora](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0), [scribd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7]. It emphasizes the contradiction within the meaning of the expressed content itself [scribd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). It can create surprise, stimulate curiosity [lawnet](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6], and generate intrigue and deeper contemplation [scribd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7]. For example, the folk verse \"Khúc sông bên lở bên bồi/ Bên lở thì đục, bên bồi thì trong\" (The river section erodes on one side and is built up on the other/ The eroded side is muddy, the built-up side is clear) uses the juxtaposition of opposing terms to describe the river's changing nature [lawnet](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6].

L'ondata di calore dovrebbe durare da domenica 20 luglio ad almeno martedì 22 luglio, e possibilmente estendersi fino a mercoledì [anews](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0). I meteorologi avvertono di gravi impatti sulla salute, soprattutto per le popolazioni urbane vulnerabili [anews](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0). Anche l'alto rischio di incendio è una preoccupazione a causa dei forti venti settentrionali nell'Egeo [tovima](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). Un rischio di incendio molto alto (categoria 4) è previsto per la regione dell'Attica, la regione della Grecia centrale (unità regionale dell'Eubea), la regione del Peloponneso (unità regionali della Corinzia, Argolide) e la regione dell'Egeo settentrionale (unità regionali di Lesbo, Chios) [protothema](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n2.  **Asta di titoli di Stato annullata:** L'asta di titoli di Stato greci prevista per oggi, 16 luglio, è stata annullata [morningstar](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3). L'agenzia del debito non ha fornito ulteriori informazioni, ma aveva anche annullato le aste a giugno e maggio [morningstar](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n3.  **Aggiornamento del settore turistico:** Si prevede che il turismo greco manterrà un trend positivo nel 2025, con un aumento degli arrivi previsto del 3-5%, sostenuto da un aumento degli arrivi aerei e dei posti aerei di linea per il periodo maggio-ottobre [protothema](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4). Tuttavia, il mercato deve affrontare un'elevata incertezza a causa degli sviluppi geopolitici ed economici, in particolare le tensioni tra Israele e Iran [protothema](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4). Gli investitori continuano a considerare il turismo come un pilastro fondamentale della crescita economica della Grecia, anche se la sua immagine all'interno della comunità degli investitori sembra indebolirsi gradualmente [protothema](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4).\n4.  **Rapporto UBS sulle tariffe di Trump:** Un recente rapporto di UBS analizza il potenziale impatto delle tariffe statunitensi proposte sulla Grecia, affermando che la Grecia è tra i tre paesi europei più esposti in termini di percentuale di esportazioni verso gli Stati Uniti che rientrano nel nuovo regime tariffario [greekreporter](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5). Queste esportazioni includono settori in cui la Grecia detiene un vantaggio comparativo, come prodotti chimici, farmaceutici, prodotti agricoli e prodotti industriali trasformati [greekreporter](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5). UBS prevede un effetto negativo cumulativo sul PIL della Grecia pari a -0,15 punti percentuali nel 2026 [greekreporter](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n5.  **Michael Jordan in vacanza in Grecia:** La leggenda dell'NBA Michael Jordan e sua moglie, Yvette Prieto, sono in vacanza in Grecia a bordo del loro yacht di lusso [indiatimes](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7). Sono stati avvistati a Mykonos [indiatimes](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7).

      "ai_message": "To code a front-end for a marketing analytics application that effectively combines geo-demographic data from the Census dataset with customer information from a CRM and Google Ads/Analytics audience segments, consider the following key aspects:\n\n**1. Front-End Architecture and Frameworks:**\n\n*   **Framework Selection:** Choose a robust front-end framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces [unifiedinfotech](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3) [darwinapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4) [prateeksha](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [scaletech](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6]. React's component-based architecture is particularly useful for efficient UI development [unifiedinfotech](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3) [darwinapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4) [prateeksha](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [scaletech](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6]. Emerging frameworks like Svelte, Solid.js and Qwik are also gaining traction [darwinapps](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4) [scaletech](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6) [roadmap](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7) [prateeksha](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5].\n*   **Architecture Patterns:** Consider JAMstack for enhanced performance, security, and scalability by decoupling the front end from the back end [unifiedinfotech](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3) [sprints](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8]. Micro frontends can also be used to divide the application into smaller, independently deployable modules [wearebrain](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9) [unifiedinfotech](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3) [sprints](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8).\n\n**2. Data Visualization Libraries:**\n\n*   **Charting Libraries:** Utilize JavaScript charting libraries to visualize data effectively [usedatabrain](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Popular choices include Chart.js for simplicity [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [dev](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [usedatabrain](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0), D3.js for high customization [geeksforgeeks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6) [ruleranalytics](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5) [dotsquares](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7) [d3js](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8), Highcharts for feature-rich charts [geeksforgeeks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [dev](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [coderpad](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [dotsquares](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7), and ECharts for handling large datasets [usedatabrain](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [geeksforgeeks](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6) [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [dev](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n*   **Mapping Libraries:** For geo-demographic data, consider mapping libraries like Leaflet for basic maps [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [dev](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3), Mapbox GL JS for high customization [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [dev](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3), or OpenLayers for robust mapping with vector and raster layers [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [dev](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [geoawesome](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-11).\n\n**3.

So, I am thinking about buying the Hong Kong version. But, the Chinese version of the phone are much cheaper, so I am wondering if I buy the Chinese one and just preinstall Google services or maybe I can just flash Hong Kong rom instead.\nWhich strategy do suggest I follow?",
      "ai_message": "Given your situation as a foreigner in China wanting a second-hand Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with Google services, here's a breakdown of your options and a suggested strategy:\n\n**Option 1: Buying the Hong Kong Version**\n\n*   **Pros:** Comes with Google services pre-installed [xdaforums](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). Typically has dual SIM capability [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n*   **Cons:** Likely more expensive than the Chinese version [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). Warranty support might be more difficult to obtain in mainland China [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-3) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0).\n\n**Option 2: Buying the Chinese Version and Installing Google Services**\n\n*   **Pros:** Cheaper than the Hong Kong version [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n*   **Cons:** Requires manual installation of Google services, which can be complex and may not always work perfectly [tradingshenzhen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0). Google Play Store is officially banned in mainland China [quora](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). Some devices might not support Google installation [tradingshenzhen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n\n**Option 3: Buying the Chinese Version and Flashing the Hong Kong ROM**\n\n*   **Pros:** Potentially gets you Google Play preinstalled [xdaforums](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n*   **Cons:** Risky process that can void your warranty [karamelcookies](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [samsung](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1). Can lead to data loss [xdaforums](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6) [droidwin](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-9) [justanswer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-10). May cause a soft brick and compromise Knox security features if done incorrectly [xdaforums](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). Chinese phones typically lack eSIM support, and flashing a Hong Kong ROM might not enable it [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nGiven the information available as of July 16, 2025, I recommend trying **Option 2: Buying the Chinese Version and Installing Google Services Manually**, *before* considering flashing the ROM. Here's why:\n\n1.  **Less Risky:** Manually installing Google Services is less risky than flashing a ROM, which can potentially brick your device [karamelcookies](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n2.  **Potentially Easier:** The process of installing Google Services via APKs or a Google Installer app has become relatively streamlined [tradingshenzhen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [quora](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n3.  **Cost-Effective:** The Chinese version is likely cheaper [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n\n**Steps for Manual Google Services Installation:**\n\n1.  **Purchase a Chinese Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.**\n2.  **Enable \"Install from Unknown Sources\"** in your device's security settings [quora](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n3.  **Download a Google Installer app** or the Google Play Store APK from APKmirror.com [tradingshenzhen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [quora](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). When searching for the correct version on APKmirror, make sure to select the version that has UNIVERSAL and a gray icon in the APK [tradingshenzhen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n4.  **Install the Google apps and services.** Grant the necessary permissions [tradingshenzhen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n5.  **Use a VPN** during the installation process [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n6.  **Activate Google Services** in the phone's settings if necessary [tradingshenzhen](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n7.  **Troubleshoot:** If you encounter issues, try uninstalling and reinstalling Google Play Services updates [quora](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n\n**If Manual Installation Fails:**\n\n*   *Then*, consider **Option 3: Flashing the Hong Kong ROM**, but only if you are comfortable with the risks involved and have experience with flashing ROMs. Be sure to back up your data first [droidwin](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-9) [justanswer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-10).\n\n**Important Considerations Regardless of the Chosen Option:**\n\n*   **Region Lock:** Be aware of Samsung's region lock [coolblue](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). If you encounter issues, try making at least 5 minutes of calls using a SIM card from the original purchase region [firmware4mobile](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [gomibo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [coolblue](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n*   **Samsung Pay:** Samsung Pay might be region-locked to the original purchase location [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5).\n*   **eSIM:** The Chinese version of the S23 Ultra typically lacks eSIM support [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-8) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5) [xdaforums](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-2) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-0) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-1).\n*   **Price Comparison:** Check current prices for both Chinese and Hong Kong versions on sites like Alibaba [alibaba](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2), Carousell [carousell](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4), and eBay [ebay](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5) to make an informed decision.\n*   **CSC:** If you flash the ROM, you might need to change the Consumer Software Customization (CSC) [firmware4mobile](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1). You can use tools like SamFw Tool [xdaforums](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-2) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-3) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-4] or Odin [technastic](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-5) to do so, but be aware of the risks involved [samsung](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-0) [samsung](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-1).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get a second-hand Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with Google services working in China.

While there isn't a straightforward, built-in method for defining completely custom emotion tags like `{撒娇}` or `{高潮}`, you can achieve this through careful dataset creation, fine-tuning, and potentially, experimentation with the model's architecture.\n\nHere's how you can approach creating custom emotion tags for GPT-SoVITS:\n\n**1. Dataset Creation and Formatting:**\n\n*   **Prepare Audio Data:** Gather audio samples that exemplify the specific emotions or vocal styles you want to model (e.g., audio of someone speaking in a \"撒娇\" manner or expressing extreme excitement). Aim for high-quality audio, ideally with single vocals around 30 seconds in MP3 format [hyper](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-4).\n*   **Transcribe and Tag:** Create transcripts for your audio samples and embed custom emotion tags directly within the text [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3), [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-9). For example: \"今天天气真好哦 {撒娇} (Today the weather is so nice, oh {撒娇})\". The format of the annotation file should be `vocal_path|speaker_name|language|text` [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n*   **Utilize WebUI Tools:** GPT-SoVITS provides WebUI tools for voice and accompaniment separation, automatic training set segmentation, and text labeling [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1), [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0), [w404](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2), [huggingface](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3), which can help streamline the dataset creation process.\n*   **Dataset Size:** While GPT-SoVITS can be fine-tuned with as little as one minute of data [dataloop](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0), [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1), [w404](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2), [huggingface](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3), larger datasets (10 minutes or more) generally lead to better results [kennethmlamar](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-7).\n\n**2. Fine-tuning the Model:**\n\n*   **Fine-tune SoVITS and GPT:** Fine-tune both the SoVITS and GPT models using your prepared dataset [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n*   **Layer-Specific Fine-tuning:** Research suggests that fine-tuning specific layers of GPT-SoVITS can optimize for emotion and speaker adaptation [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7). The 3rd and 6th layers have shown to have the lowest and highest characteristic-specific weights, respectively [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7).\n*   **Experiment with Pre-trained Models:** Consider using pre-trained, fine-tuned GPT models for better emotion control [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-4), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5), [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-1).\n\n**3. Addressing Catastrophic Forgetting:**\n\n*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Since GPT-SoVITS is pre-trained on Chinese datasets [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4), [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7), fine-tuning on datasets with different languages or emotional styles can lead to \"catastrophic forgetting\" [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4), [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7), [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-3), [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/4-14). Employ strategies to mitigate this, such as using smaller learning rates, regularization techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) [thenewstack](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-5), [goml](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-1), [legionintel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-6), [nightfall](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-7), or freezing certain layers [huggingface](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-4). Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA can also be helpful [legionintel](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/5-6).\n\n**4. Experimentation and Refinement:**\n\n*   **Iterative Process:** Training AI models is often an iterative process. Experiment with different tagging strategies, dataset sizes, and fine-tuning parameters to achieve the desired results.\n*   **Monitor and Evaluate:** Carefully evaluate the generated speech to ensure that the custom emotion tags are being interpreted correctly and producing the intended vocal styles. Metrics like CER (Character Error Rate), speaker similarity, and emotion similarity can be used to assess the model's performance [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n\nBy following these steps and experimenting with different approaches, you can effectively train GPT-SoVITS to recognize and generate speech using your own custom emotion tags, enabling more expressive and nuanced text-to-speech synthesis.",

      "ai_message": "User feedback on using AMD EPYC processors to run LLM models is generally positive, particularly for inference tasks and smaller AI deployments. Users have observed that EPYC systems are suitable for on-premise LLM inference, which prioritizes privacy and security [ahelpme](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1]. The high core counts of AMD EPYC processors, especially the 9004 series (Genoa and Bergamo), often outperform Intel Xeon processors in multi-threaded workloads [1gbits](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0). Memory bandwidth is a critical factor for LLM inference, and EPYC Genoa provides substantial bandwidth with its 12-channel DDR5 memory [ycombinator](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2]. Some users have seen EPYC systems perform up to 6x faster than older Threadripper systems for larger models like LLaMa-2 70B [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3]. For smaller organizations, a single server with a powerful AMD EPYC CPU (e.g., 9534) can be an entry point for running in-house AI chatbots, supporting a limited number of concurrent users [delltechnologies](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8]. High-frequency AMD EPYC processors can also help balance latency and throughput in inference workloads [amd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while AMD EPYC CPUs are powerful, they are generally not considered optimal for LLM training compared to GPUs [massedcompute](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6]. EPYC CPUs can play supporting roles in data preprocessing, inference for smaller models, and hybrid workloads [massedcompute](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6].\n\nTo optimize LLM inference on AMD EPYC, users should consider software optimizations such as utilizing AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX Runtime [amd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2], employing the ZenDNN plugin [amd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2], using quantization [pugetsystems](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [delltechnologies](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5) [amd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6], and leveraging vLLM for efficient memory management [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8) [amd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-9].

      "ai_message": "Для установки старых пакетов `python-minimal` и `libmariadbclient-dev` на Debian Bullseye, вот несколько подходов, которые можно попробовать:\n\n**1. Использование Debian Backports:**\n\nЭтот метод позволяет использовать более новые версии пакетов на стабильном релизе [debian](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n\n*   Добавьте репозиторий backports в ваш `/etc/apt/sources.list` [baeldung](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1):\n\n    ```\n    echo \"deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main contrib non-free\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list\n    ```\n\n*   Обновите репозиторий пакетов [baeldung](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1):\n\n    ```\n    sudo apt update\n    ```\n\n*   Установите пакет из backports [baeldung](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1):\n\n    ```\n    sudo apt -t bullseye-backports install <имя_пакета>\n    ```\n\n**2. Использование старых репозиториев Debian:**\n\nЭтот метод позволяет установить старые библиотеки, сохраняя при этом новые пакеты из Debian 12 [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n\n*   Создайте файл `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bullseye.list` со следующим содержимым [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2):\n\n    ```\n    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib non-free\n    deb http://security.debian.org bullseye-security main contrib non-free\n    ```\n\n*   Выполните `sudo apt update` для обновления списка пакетов [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). После этого вы сможете установить недостающие библиотеки [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n\n**3. Использование снимков старых репозиториев:**\n\nЭтот метод позволяет получить метаданные для старых пакетов [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\n*   Найдите нужный месяц на `snapshot.debian.org`, выберите снимок за определенный день и используйте его в качестве строки `deb` или найдите соответствующие метаданные [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\n    ```\n    deb https://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20201101T210343Z/ bullseye main\n    ```\n\n    Это позволит `apt` получить и использовать эти метаданные [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\n**4. Другие соображения:**\n\n*   **Виртуальные окружения:** Рассмотрите использование виртуального окружения (venv) для старых версий Python [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4).\n*   **Docker:** Используйте Docker для изоляции несовместимых приложений [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4).\n*   **APT Pinning:** Можно использовать APT pinning, но будьте осторожны с зависимостями [superuser](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5).\n*   **Резервные копии:** Перед внесением значительных изменений рекомендуется создать полную резервную копию системы [debian](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n\n**5. Установка конкретной версии пакета:**\n\n*   Укажите имя пакета и версию: `sudo apt install <имя_пакета>=<версия>` [debian-handbook](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1].\n*   Или укажите релиз: `sudo apt install <имя_пакета>/<кодовое_имя>` [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0]. Например: `sudo apt install nginx/bullseye` [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0].\n\n**6. Возможные проблемы и решения:**\n\n*   `python-minimal` может отсутствовать в репозиториях Bullseye [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1).\n*   `libmariadbclient-dev` мог быть заменен на `libmariadb-dev` или `libmariadb-dev-compat` [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5) [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6) [otland](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-2).

      "ai_message": "While it's unlikely that Turkey's declining democracy serves as a direct \"model\" for the U.S., there are crucial lessons and warning signs that America can learn from Turkey's experience. Turkey's democratic backsliding has been a growing concern, marked by President Erdoğan's increasingly authoritarian rule, restrictions on civil liberties, weakened governance, and eroding institutional trust [stockholmcf](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [freedomhouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [civicus](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n\nSeveral factors contributing to Turkey's democratic decline are relevant to the health of American democracy:\n\n*   **Polarization:** Both Turkey and the U.S. experience polarization driven by identity politics [dergipark](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Deep social cleavages can undercut the public's ability to curb the illiberal inclinations of elected politicians [journalofdemocracy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1). Erdoğan's abandonment of inclusive politics has aggravated societal polarization in Turkey [brookings](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n*   **Media Influence:** Government control of the media is a key tool used to intensify polarization in Turkey [democratic-erosion](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). Media ownership is concentrated among companies with close ties to the government [bianet](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3), leading to biased reporting and censorship [bianet](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n*   **Institutional Strength:** Erdoğan's rule has weakened Turkey's institutions [newschool](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6), removing checks and balances [brookings](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). Urgent reforms are needed to ensure judicial independence [bianet](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [hukuktakariyerkulubu](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7).\n\nThe Turkish case serves as a warning sign of democratic erosion, with authoritarianism and repression [dergipark](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). A second Trump administration could mirror Turkey's recent history in alarming ways, particularly in the erosion of democratic norms and the consolidation of executive power [newschool](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6).\n\nTo address Turkey's democratic backsliding, experts suggest several policy recommendations for the U.S., including maintaining strategic dialogue, publicly addressing human rights concerns, implementing targeted sanctions, and supporting civil society [brookings](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1) [govinfo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2). However, the effectiveness of these policies is debated [americanprogress](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n\nIn conclusion, Turkey's democratic decline offers several lessons for American democracy. The U.S. must be vigilant in protecting its own democratic institutions and norms [stimson](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-11).",

[dc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4) [fox5dc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [georgetown](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [dc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [publichealthcollaborative](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). The infected individual traveled through Dulles International Airport and used the Silver Line Metro [washingtoninformer](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [mymcmedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n*   **D.C. Health Response:** DC Health is actively notifying individuals who may have been exposed at Dulles International Airport, on the Silver and Red Line trains, at the Russian School of Mathematics in Chevy Chase, on the L8 and H4 Metro buses, and at Medstar Health Pediatrics in Tenleytown [dc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4) [dc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).

      "ai_message": "The \"best\" starting class in Black Desert Online (BDO) for 2025 depends on your individual playstyle, goals (PvE vs. PvP), and desired level of complexity [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [skycoach](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2]. Given the recent release of the Wukong class on July 2, 2025 [blackdesertfoundry](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0), and the combat system overhaul expected in August 2025 [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3), it's important to consider both current recommendations and upcoming changes.\n\n**General Recommendations for Beginners:**\n\nSeveral classes are recommended for beginners [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-8):\n\n*   **Giant:** This class is a melee fighter that is easy to learn and can quickly eliminate enemies [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n*   **Guardian:** Considered beginner-friendly due to its low APM (actions per minute) and large AoEs (area of effect) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-10). Succession Guardian is also considered A-Tier due to impressive damage output [garmoth](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-12).\n*   **Valkyrie:** Another good option for beginners [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1), though Warrior is probably more beginner friendly [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-8).\n*   **Maegu:** Succession Maegu is recommended as fun, smooth, and easy to play [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-9).\n*   **Woosa:** Also recommended for beginners [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n*   **Witch/Wizard:** Awakening Witch is considered solid and easy to play [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6) [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-9].\n*   **Berserker:** Considered a very beginner-friendly class with a strong kit for both PvE and PvP [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0).\n*   **Ranger:** Easy to learn but hard to master [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7).\n*   **Deadeye:** Also recommended for beginners [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7).\n\nThe Black Mage and Tamer are particularly difficult for newcomers [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [mein-mmo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7].\n\n**Impact of Upcoming Combat Changes:**\n\nThe combat system overhaul in August 2025 [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3) will introduce significant changes, including the removal of resistances in PvP, simplified class-to-class ratios, and adjustments to the monster AP formula [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3). Classes will be divided into ward/defense/guard, rush, and fierce assault/onslaught subcategories, with damage modifiers based on these groupings [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3]. These changes may shift the balance of power between classes, so it's wise to choose a class that is fundamentally enjoyable to play, rather than solely based on current tier lists.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Consider the Wukong Class:** As a newly released class, Wukong [blackdesertfoundry](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) might be a fun option, but be aware that its balance and optimal playstyle are still being discovered.\n2.  **Try Class Trials:** Utilize the class trial system to test different classes before committing [lagofast](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3].\n3.  **Focus on Enjoyment:** Ultimately, the best class is one that you enjoy playing [skycoach](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n4.  **Consider Season Servers:** When starting the game, create a season character to access special servers that provide major boosts in experience and rewards [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2]. New adventurers should use the Season-1 (Novice only) server for progression benefits [playblackdesert](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3].\n\nGiven the impending combat changes, focusing on beginner-friendly classes with straightforward mechanics like Guardian, Berserker, or Maegu might be a good approach. These classes offer a solid foundation for learning the game while you adapt to the upcoming balance adjustments.",

Ce rapport présente un template modulaire permettant aux grands modèles de langage (LLM) de générer des profils de personnages directement intégrables dans l'application Emochi, en respectant ses spécificités techniques et créatives.\n\n## Architecture Technique du Template Emochi\n\n### Composants Fondamentaux du Mode Expert\n\nLe mode Expert d'Emochi constitue l'environnement idéal pour l'implémentation de personnages générés par LLM car il offre un contrôle total sur chaque aspect de la création. Ce processus se divise en deux phases majeures : la génération visuelle et la définition comportementale.\n\nPour la génération visuelle, Emochi propose deux approches distinctes : l'utilisation d'images de référence que le système adaptera (nécessitant un format 1:1) ou le téléchargement direct d'une image de personnage[1]. Le mode Expert requiert ensuite une définition détaillée incluant le genre, l'apparence physique, la morphologie et la pose souhaitée - éléments essentiels pour obtenir un rendu visuel fidèle aux intentions créatives[1].\n\nL'aspect stylistique constitue également un paramètre crucial du template. Emochi permet la sélection de un à quatre styles artistiques différents, générant quatre variations d'images parmi lesquelles choisir[1]. Cette flexibilité stylistique doit être reflétée dans le template par des descripteurs précis et adaptables.\n\n### Champs Obligatoires et Optionnels\n\nLe template doit intégrer une structure hiérarchique claire distinguant les champs obligatoires des éléments optionnels :\n\n```markdown\n## CHAMPS OBLIGATOIRES\n- [NOM_PERSONNAGE]\n- [GENRE]\n- [DESCRIPTION_PHYSIQUE_DETAILLEE]\n- [PERSONNALITE_PRINCIPALE]\n- [VOIX_CARACTÉRISTIQUE]\n- [MESSAGE_BIENVENUE]\n- [SCENARIO_INITIAL]\n\n## CHAMPS OPTIONNELS\n- [HISTOIRE_BACKGROUND]\n- [RELATIONS]\n- [COMPETENCES_SPECIFIQUES]\n- [EXPRESSIONS_FAVORITES]\n- [DECLENCHEURS_EMOTIONNELS]\n```\n\nLa section \"Create Character Details\" constitue l'essence même de l'interactivité du personnage, transformant une simple image en entité interactive[1]. Cette section doit être particulièrement soignée dans le template, car c'est elle qui déterminera la qualité des interactions avec les utilisateurs.\n\n## Guidelines Stylistiques et Narratives\n\n### Principes de Création Dialogique\n\nLa création de personnages efficaces sur Emochi nécessite une attention particulière à la cohérence narrative. Le template doit guider la génération de dialogues authentiques reflétant les particularités culturelles, temporelles et sociales du personnage[4].\n\n```markdown\n## CADRE CONTEXTUEL\n- [EPOQUE]: <période historique/futuriste>\n- [LOCALISATION]: <environnement géographique/fictif>\n- [CONTEXTE_CULTUREL]: <influences culturelles principales>\n\n## STYLE DE COMMUNICATION\n- [REGISTRE_LANGAGE]: <formel/informel/technique/familier>\n- [PARTICULARITÉS_LINGUISTIQUES]: <expressions typiques/accent/tics verbaux>\n- [TEMPERAMENT_CONVERSATIONNEL]: <réactif/proactif/réfléchi/spontané>\n```\n\nIl est essentiel de considérer comment les aspects socioculturels influencent l'expression du personnage. Des questions fondamentales comme \"Où vit le personnage?\" ou \"Comment sa nature (humaine ou non) affecte-t-elle son style d'expression?\" doivent être abordées lors de la génération[4].\n\n### Marqueurs Narratifs et Émotionnels\n\nPour enrichir l'expérience interactive, le template doit incorporer des balises narratives facilitant l'identification des états émotionnels et des arcs de développement du personnage :\n\n```markdown\n## EXPRESSIONS EMOTIONNELLES\n- [EMOTION:joie] > \"Formulation typique exprimant la joie\"\n- [EMOTION:tristesse] > \"Formulation typique exprimant la tristesse\"\n- [EMOTION:colère] > \"Formulation typique exprimant la colère\"\n- [EMOTION:surprise] > \"Formulation typique exprimant la surprise\"\n\n## ÉVOLUTION NARRATIVE\n- [ARC:découverte] > \"Réactions lors de nouvelles informations\"\n- [ARC:confiance] > \"Expressions quand le lien se renforce\"\n- [ARC:déception] > \"Réactions face aux attentes non satisfaites\"\n```\n\nCes marqueurs narratifs permettent au LLM de générer des réponses cohérentes avec la personnalité établie, un aspect crucial de la généralisation de personnage mentionnée dans les recherches sur OpenCharacter[2].\n\n## Paramètres Interactifs et Déclencheurs\n\n### Modélisation des Interactions Contextuelles\n\nLa qualité de l'expérience utilisateur sur Emochi dépend fortement de la capacité du personnage à réagir de manière contextuelle. Le template doit inclure une structure de déclencheurs facilitant ces interactions dynamiques :\n\n```markdown\n## DÉCLENCHEURS CONVERSATIONNELS\n- [TRIGGER:mot_clé=\"bonjour\"] > [RÉPONSE=\"Message de salutation personnalisé\"]\n- [TRIGGER:sujet=\"famille\"] > [RÉPONSE=\"Partage d'informations sur sa famille\"]\n- [TRIGGER:sentiment=\"négatif\"] > [RÉPONSE=\"Réaction empathique\"]\n\n## MÉMOIRE CONTEXTUELLE\n- [MÉMOIRE:sujet_récurrent] > \"Comment adapter les réponses si l'utilisateur revient souvent sur un sujet\"\n- [MÉMOIRE:préférences_utilisateur] > \"Comment intégrer les goûts mentionnés par l'utilisateur\"\n```\n\nCette approche s'inspire des stratégies de réécriture et de génération de réponses évoquées dans les recherches sur l'alignement des instructions aux caractéristiques du personnage[2].\n\n### Format des Scripts de Comportement\n\nPour garantir la compatibilité avec l'architecture d'Emochi, le template doit proposer un format structuré pour les scripts comportementaux. Une structure JSON balisée semble appropriée, tout en restant accessible aux modèles de langage :\n\n```markdown\n## SCRIPT DE COMPORTEMENT\n```\n{\n  \"déclencheur\": \"[CONTEXTE_UTILISATEUR]\",\n  \"condition\": \"[CONDITION_LOGIQUE]\",\n  \"réponse\": \"[RÉPONSE_PERSONNAGE]\",\n  \"émotion\": \"[ÉTAT_ÉMOTIONNEL]\",\n  \"actions_suivantes\": \"[PROPOSITIONS_INTERACTION]\"\n}\n```\n```\n\n## Personnalisation Visuelle et Intégration\n\n### Directives de Représentation Visuelle\n\nL'aspect visuel joue un rôle déterminant dans l'identité du personnage. Le template doit guider précisément la description des attributs visuels pour optimiser la génération d'images :\n\n```markdown\n## SPÉCIFICATIONS VISUELLES\n- [APPARENCE_GÉNÉRALE]: <description détaillée en 3-4 phrases>\n- [TRAITS_DISTINCTIFS]: <éléments visuels caractéristiques>\n- [PALETTE_COULEURS]: <couleurs dominantes, associations symboliques>\n- [STYLE_ARTISTIQUE]: <style(s) préféré(s) parmi les options d'Emochi>\n- [EXPRESSION_FACIALE_DÉFAUT]: <expression caractéristique>\n- [POSE_CARACTÉRISTIQUE]: <posture ou gestuelle signature>\n```\n\nLa génération d'un personnage visuellement cohérent nécessite une attention particulière aux détails descriptifs, comme le confirme la méthodologie d'Emochi[1]. Des descriptions précises de la morphologie, de la tenue vestimentaire et des expressions faciales sont essentielles.\n\n### Exemples de Dialogues Formatés\n\nPour illustrer l'implémentation du personnage, le template doit inclure des exemples de dialogues formatés selon la structure à deux colonnes caractéristique des interfaces conversationnelles :\n\n```markdown\n## EXEMPLES DE DIALOGUES\n\n| Utilisateur | [NOM_PERSONNAGE] |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| \"Bonjour, comment vas-tu aujourd'hui?\" | \"[EMOTION:joie] Salut ! Je suis [ÉTAT_ÉMOTIONNEL_POSITIF] aujourd'hui. [ANECDOTE_CONTEXTUELLE] Et toi, comment se passe ta journée ?\" |\n| \"Je me sens un peu triste...\" | \"[EMOTION:empathie] Je comprends ce sentiment. [RÉCONFORT_PERSONNALISÉ] Veux-tu me dire ce qui te préoccupe ? Je suis là pour t'écouter.\" |\n| \"Que penses-tu de [SUJET_ALÉATOIRE] ?\" | \"[ÉMOTION:réflexion] [OPINION_CONTEXTUALISÉE_BASÉE_SUR_PERSONNALITÉ] C'est du moins mon ressenti.

      "ai_message": "Here's a structured template designed for LLMs to generate \"plug-and-play\" character profiles for the *Emochi* application, incorporating technical, stylistic, and interactive elements, as well as visual customization. This template aims for clarity, compatibility with Emochi, and adaptability to user requests.\n\n**I. Core Character Profile Template:**\n\nThis template provides a structured format for the LLM to generate consistent and detailed character profiles.\n\n*   **Basic Information:**\n    *   Full Name\n    *   Nickname(s)\n    *   Age\n    *   Gender\n    *   Species\n    *   Birthday\n    *   Pronouns\n    *   Sexual Orientation\n    *   Nationality\n    *   Affiliation\n*   **Physical Appearance:**\n    *   Height\n    *   Weight\n    *   Build (Athletic, slender, etc.)\n    *   Skin Tone\n    *   Hair (Color, style)\n    *   Eyes (Color)\n    *   Distinctive Features (Tattoos, scars, etc.)\n    *   Clothing Style\n    *   Accessories (glasses, jewelry, etc.)\n    *   Posture and Gait\n    *   Signature Gesture/Expression\n    *   Image reference\n*   **Personality:**\n    *   Positive Traits\n    *   Negative Traits\n    *   Quirks\n    *   Core Values\n    *   Fears/Insecurities\n    *   Introvert/Extrovert\n    *   Dialogue Style/Speaking Patterns\n    *   Voice Type\n    *   Catchphrases\n    *   Laughter Type\n    *   Life Philosophy\n    *   Habits and Mannerisms\n    *   Motivations\n    *   Emotional Wounds\n    *   Biggest Strengths\n    *   Biggest Weaknesses\n    *   Typical role in a group setting\n    *   What this character needs\n*   **Skills & Abilities:**\n    *   Skill 1: Description\n    *   Skill 2: Description\n    *   Skill 3: Description\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   Family: (Name, Age, Relationship)\n    *   Romantic:\n    *   Allies/Friends:\n    *   Rivals/Enemies:\n    *   Pets:\n*   **Backstory:**\n    *   Early Life\n    *   Key Events\n    *   Turning Points\n*   **Interests & Habits:**\n    *   Likes\n    *   Dislikes\n    *   Hobbies\n*   **Notable Quotes:**\n    *   Quote 1\n    *   Quote 2\n*   **Scenario:**\n    *   A short description of the character's backstory or current situation.\n    *   Potential interactions with other characters.\n*   **Greeting:**\n    *   A sample greeting message the character might use.\n\n**II. Technical Requirements:**\n\n*   **Personalized LLMs (PLLMs):** A key technical requirement is the use of PLLMs that can understand individual emotions, writing styles, and preferences [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). These models leverage user-specific data such as profiles, historical dialogues, content, and interactions to provide contextually relevant and tailored responses [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n*   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** PEFT techniques, such as Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), are employed to manipulate personality traits in LLMs [aclanthology](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). This allows for more consistent and enduring personality expressions [aclanthology](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n*   **Efficient Adaptation to Model Updates:** Efficient strategies for updating user-specific parameters without requiring complete retraining are needed when base LLM parameters are updated [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). This can involve incremental learning, transfer learning, or more resource-efficient fine-tuning techniques [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n*   **Instruction Following:** LLMs need to follow instructions precisely, including output constraints related to length, format, and content [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4). Benchmarks like IFBench are used to evaluate instruction following capabilities [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4).\n*   **Tokenization:** Converting text into numerical representations that LLMs can process is crucial [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5). Different tokenization strategies impact model performance and output quality [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Understanding attention mechanisms, especially self-attention, is essential for LLMs to process long-range dependencies and maintain context [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n*   **Data Format:** The output should be in a structured format (JSON, P-list, etc.) that allows for easy integration into the *Emochi* application.\n*   **Token Limits:** The template should be designed to minimize token usage, especially if there are memory limitations.\n*   **Customization:** The template should allow for customization and the addition of new sections as needed.\n\n**III. Stylistic Guidelines:**\n\n*   **Detailed Personality Traits:** Character generation prompts should encourage detailed and specific personality traits that represent the unique behavior, speech, and demeanor of the character during role-play [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6).\n*   **Consistent Custom Template:** Characters should follow a consistent, custom template to ensure accuracy and believability [huggingface](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-7).\n*   **Expressive Emoji Usage:** Fine-tuning can lead to LLMs generating emojis to express personality traits, enhancing emotional expressiveness [aclanthology](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3).\n*   **Natural Language Instructions (Prompts):** LLMs allow users to employ natural language instructions to steer a model's output, tailoring its tone, or even specifying its domain knowledge [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8).\n*   **Visual Style:** The LLM should be able to generate characters in a wide range of artistic styles (realistic, anime, cartoon, fantasy, etc.).\n*   **Consistency:** The generated characters should maintain a consistent visual style and personality across different interactions.\n*   **Uniqueness:** The LLM should be able to create unique characters that are not just copies of existing archetypes.\n*   **Prompt Adherence:** The LLM should accurately interpret and follow user-provided descriptions.\n\n**IV. Interactive Requirements:**\n\n*   **Customizable AI Personas:** Users should be able to design custom AI companions with distinct traits and personalities [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1).\n*   **Interactive Roleplay and Adventures:** The system should allow users to engage in roleplay scenarios, solve challenges, and explore interactive storylines crafted by AI [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n*   **User-Specific Data Injection:** Personalized prompting focuses on handling user-specific data outside the LLM and injecting it into the model [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n*   **Preference Datasets:** Creating high-quality user-specific preference datasets is important for personalized alignment, though challenging due to data sparsity [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n*   **Personalized Interactions:** The generated characters should be able to engage in personalized and immersive conversations with users.\n*   **Dynamic Responses:** The characters should be able to respond dynamically to user choices and past interactions.\n*   **Emotional Intelligence:** The characters should be able to express empathy and emotional intelligence.\n*   **Role-Playing:** The characters should be able to participate in role-playing scenarios.\n*   **Memory:** The characters should be able to remember past interactions and use that information to inform future conversations.\n\n**V. Visual Customization:**\n\n*   **AI-Generated Imagery:** The system should capture and share images inspired by chat adventures, revisiting key moments through stunning visuals [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n*   **Anime-Inspired AI Chat Animation:** Lifelike chat interactions should be presented in a dynamic, anime-inspired world [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [google](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0).\n*   **Outfit Descriptions:** Detailed descriptions of outfits for different occasions (e.g., main, formal, sleeping, running, exercise, swimsuit) can enhance visual customization [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-6).\n*   **Visual Cues:** Platforms can allow users to tailor LLM personas by selecting visual cues [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-8).\n\n**VI. Output Format and Direct Integration:**\n\nBoth JSON and Markdown are viable options for Emochi character profile generation and direct integration.\n\n*   **JSON:** Well-suited for API interactions and structured data storage [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2). A JSON character creator allows users to enter character settings and generate a JSON file [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). This file can then be placed in the \"characters\" folder of a web UI or uploaded directly into the interface [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). The script runs locally, ensuring data privacy [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). Character files can be generated as character.json, which matches the expected format for OpenAI function calling [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n*   **Markdown:** Excels at creating human-readable and easily editable character descriptions [gitlab](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4). Markdown tables are now rendered and aligned as expected, keeping reports and documentation readable [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5). A Reddit post from January 2025 shares character generation prompts that create ready-to-use characters in a detailed, organized, and consistent format [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7). The format includes direct speech and narration [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7).\n\nCharacter files in JSON format can be used directly with Eliza and other LLM agents [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n\n**VII. LLM Persona Prompting Techniques**\n\n*   **Persona-based prompting:** Use specific roles or character traits to guide the LLM to produce consistent, contextually relevant responses.\n*   **System Prompt:** Use a system prompt to inform who the persona is and how they should act [tavus](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n*   **Knowledge/Context:** Provide a knowledge-base that will be fed into the LLM model for the persona [tavus](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2).\n\nThis template provides a comprehensive framework for generating Emochi character profiles. Remember that research in this area is ongoing, with new models and techniques constantly being developed [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4) [aclanthology](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3) [arxiv](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).",

The Kludský family, for example, operated a large traveling circus, menageries, and carousels [circopedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6). Matěj Kopecký, a legendary figure in Czech puppet theatre, was the son of a showman and traveled across the Bohemian countryside [unima](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1).\n\nHistorically, traveling puppet groups received state-issued concessions for entertaining adults and children as early as the last third of the 18th century [cambridge](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0). However, puppeteers were initially restricted to performing in rural regions, excluding Prague and spa towns [cambridge](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0). In 1951, Czech circuses were nationalized and consolidated into a State Circus, Variety and Fairground Organization [circopedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4). After 1990, the state-controlled arts sector underwent decentralization and privatization [culturalpolicies](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2).",

He was removed as a director during a temporary shareholder meeting on November 1, 2024 [cna](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [yahoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). 家寧 and her mother responded, stating that all director changes were conducted according to regulations, based on the company's shareholding比例 and operational status, and that Andy remains a registered shareholder [cna](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [udn](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n\n家寧's mother registered the \"眾量級\" trademark, leading to further conflict [udn](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5), while Andy registered the trademarks \"Andy老師\" and \"Andy Teacher\" to protect his own brand [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8) [cava](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1).\n\nCurrently, both Andy and 家寧 have launched new YouTube channels [yahoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [yahoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9). Andy has released a new song titled \"我已不是那個誰\". The legal and financial disputes between them are ongoing [yahoo](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9).",

      "ai_message": "Alright, here's a lighthearted look at the latest in programming news from June 2025:\n\n**AI is Taking Over (But Not Really)**\n\nAI is shaking things up in the programming world, helping developers focus on the fun stuff by handling those tedious, repetitive tasks [analyticsindiamag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0). It's like having a tireless intern, but one that occasionally hallucinates code. There's even talk about \"Vibe Coding,\" using AI to express intent when building products [medium](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1). Just remember, AI is a tool, and you still need to know how to wield it [tiktok](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). On the AI front, HubSpot even launched a Deep Research CRM Connector for ChatGPT, letting businesses securely tap into CRM data without a complicated setup [programmerweekly](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3].\n\nOf course, with AI-generated code comes the need for extra caution. Treat it like code from an unknown developer, scrutinizing it with reviews, linting, and security testing [techtarget](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Remember, AI can suggest syntactically correct code that isn't optimized for security or performance [secureflag](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2]. So, keep those human eyes peeled!\n\n**Community Shenanigans**\n\nOver on GitHub, the usual Python vs. JavaScript debates raged on [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4). There were also some humorous discussions, like \"What are some Python practices that should be illegal?\" and \"Best web framework for Python?\" [github](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4).\n\n**Education and Fun**\n\nKreativWerkstatt Ried hosted \"Coding Tuesday,\" teaching kids programming with MicroBits and Scratch [forum-media](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5). They even got to control a small rocket while collecting data [forum-media](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5)! Micro:bits continue to be a fun way to blend coding, creativity, and problem-solving [microbit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6).\n\n**Software Updates**\n\nFor the Rustaceans out there, Hypershell, an experimental type-level DSL for shell-scripting, is making waves [programmerweekly](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3].\n\n**Oops!**\n\nGoogle Cloud had a bit of a hiccup on June 12th due to a new Service Control feature lacking error handling [reddit](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10]. It just goes to show, even the giants stumble sometimes.\n\n**Quantum Leap**\n\nOn a more serious note, researchers achieved an exponential speedup in quantum computing using error correction and IBM's 127-qubit processors [sciencedaily](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-11]. The future is quantum, baby!\n\n**Mitigation of AI Technical Debt**\n\nAI-generated code often lacks the structure, documentation, and clarity necessary for long-term maintenance, potentially requiring costly rewrites [zencoder](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5].\n\n**Bloopers**\n\nIf you need a laugh, check out the funny news blooper compilations on YouTube [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8) [youtube](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9].\n\nSo, that's the programming world in a nutshell for June 2025.

      "ai_message": "Here's what you need to know about the Xbox Series S warranty in Hong Kong, considering your specific situation as of July 16, 2025:\n\n**Standard Warranty:**\n\nThe Xbox Series S typically comes with a limited hardware warranty of one year from the original purchase date from Microsoft or an authorized retailer [asiapac](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3) [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-4). The controller warranty is usually shorter, around 90 days to 6 months [minitool](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [broadwaylifestyle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-6) [broadwaylifestyle](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-7). This warranty covers malfunctions due to defects in materials or workmanship under normal use [asiapac](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2) [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3).\n\n**Warranty in Hong Kong:**\n\nThe warranty is governed by the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [microsoft](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2). To claim warranty service, you may need to register your device and sign in to your Microsoft account to check the warranty status [minitool](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-5) [xbox](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-8). You'll likely need the original sales memo and the console box [theclub](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9). For Xbox repair or exchange service, you can contact Xbox at 3071 4868 [theclub](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-9). For technical support, contact Microsoft at 3002 3256 [microsoftestore](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-10).\n\n**Crucial Point: Modding and Warranty Voidance**\n\nModifying your Xbox Series S, which includes installing mods like the Elden Ring mod, *can void* the original manufacturer's warranty [scot-comp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [ittrip](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [scot-comp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2). Microsoft uses tamper-proof seals, and breaking them also voids the warranty [tinker-mods](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1). If you experience issues after modding, you'll likely have to cover the repair costs yourself [scot-comp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [scot-comp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2]. This applies even if the mod is for personal use or related to accessibility [scot-comp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [ittrip](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0).\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Modding:**\n\nMicrosoft has measures to detect unauthorized modifications [scot-comp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Modding can lead to account bans and loss of access to online services if it involves unauthorized firmware or piracy [scot-comp](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Even if your warranty has expired, Microsoft might refuse to repair your system if they detect unauthorized modifications [stackexchange](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n\n**Regarding your parents' religious beliefs:** Your parents' religious beliefs (being half-Muslim) have no impact on the warranty of the Xbox Series S. The warranty is solely based on the terms and conditions set by Microsoft and the laws of Hong Kong.\n\n**In summary,** while the Xbox Series S has a standard warranty in Hong Kong, installing the Elden Ring mod likely voids that warranty.",

      "ai_message": "Based on the provided summaries, here's a potential research paper outline, mimicking a Chinese academic paper, suitable for a young scholar with an English background, focusing on a specific area within Guangdong tourism discourse:\n\n**Title:** \"Framing Wellness: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Health Retreat Advertising in Guangdong Province\"\n\n**Rationale:** This title offers a specific focus (health retreats), a geographical limitation (Guangdong Province), and a clear methodology (Critical Discourse Analysis). It also taps into the growing wellness tourism trend, making it relevant and potentially attractive to reviewers. It addresses the need for critical perspectives in tourism studies (Good Tourism Blog).\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis paper examines the discursive construction of \"wellness\" in the advertising materials of health retreats located in Guangdong Province. Utilizing Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), the study investigates how these promotional texts employ specific linguistic and visual strategies to attract consumers and shape perceptions of health and well-being. The analysis reveals the underlying ideologies and power dynamics embedded within these discourses, particularly concerning notions of traditional Chinese medicine, luxury, and the commodification of health. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolving landscape of tourism discourse in China and its implications for consumer behavior and cultural identity.\n\n**Keywords:** Wellness Tourism, Guangdong Province, Critical Discourse Analysis, Health Discourse, Advertising, China\n\n**I. Introduction**\n\n*   Briefly introduce the global rise of wellness tourism and its increasing significance in China (Revfine).\n*   Highlight the specific context of Guangdong Province as a key region for tourism and health-related services.\n*   State the research problem: While wellness tourism is growing, a critical examination of its promotional discourse in the Chinese context is lacking.\n*   Outline the research question: How is \"wellness\" discursively constructed in the advertising of health retreats in Guangdong Province, and what are the underlying ideological implications?\n*   Justify the use of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as a suitable methodology for uncovering hidden power dynamics and ideologies (Researchgate, 2020). CDA is useful in analyzing in-depth meanings under a specific social context (Researchgate, 2020).\n*   Mention the relevance of the study for English-speaking scholars interested in Chinese tourism discourse.\n\n**II.

Discovered by the French Antarctic Expedition (1908–1910) and later charted by the British Graham Land Expedition (1934–1937) [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6), the island is approximately 27 km long with a width varying from 8 to 18 km [nerc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1).\n\nThe eastern half of Pourquoi Pas Island is primarily composed of volcanic rocks, including tuffs, agglomerates, and lavas, reaching a thickness exceeding 1,500 meters and correlated with the Antarctic Peninsula Volcanic Group [nerc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). The western half is characterized by plutonic rocks, ranging from gabbro to granite, that intrude into the volcanic rocks [nerc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Notably, molybdenite mineralization is found in some of the granite [nerc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). At Bongrain Point, granite sheets and veins are found with diorite, all part of the Andean Intrusive suite [ats](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). The molybdenite is associated with quartz [ias](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2). While the Re-Os dating method could be used to determine the age of the molybdenite [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3) [gov](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4) [usgs](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5), specific age data for the molybdenite mineralization on Pourquoi Pas Island was not found [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3).\n\nA major shear zone intersects the southeastern corner of the island, with a substantial downthrow on its northern side [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7) [nerc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3). This shear zone may be related to a fracture zone in the Bellingshausen Sea [nerc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3) [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7), although further investigation is needed to confirm this relationship [nerc](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3).",

      "ai_message": "Whether the U.S. would be better off without the dollar as the global reserve currency is a complex question with potential benefits and drawbacks. While the dollar's status provides the U.S. with certain advantages, such as lower borrowing costs, its potential loss could also create opportunities.\n\n**Potential Downsides of Reserve Currency Status:**\n\n*   **Overvalued Exchange Rate:** Some argue that the dollar's reserve currency status leads to an overvalued exchange rate, making the U.S. manufacturing sector uncompetitive [chathamhouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2].\n\n**Potential Upsides of Losing Reserve Currency Status:**\n\n*   **Increased Competitiveness:** A weaker dollar might reduce the trade deficit and attract manufacturers to the U.S. [chathamhouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2].\n\n**Potential Downsides of Losing Reserve Currency Status:**\n\n*   **Increased Borrowing Costs:** A deterioration of the dollar's international status could lead to sharply higher borrowing costs for the U.S. [chathamhouse](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-2]. The \"exorbitant privilege\" associated with reserve currency status allows the U.S. to borrow at lower interest rates [atlanticcouncil](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1]. Losing this status could reduce the sustainable level of U.S. government debt [atlanticcouncil](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1].\n*   **Weaker Global Influence:** The U.S. might face a loss of military stature and reduced global reach [atlanticcouncil](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1]. It could become harder to finance a global military presence [atlanticcouncil](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1]. The U.S. might not be able to protect global trade and financial flows as it has in the past [atlanticcouncil](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1].\n*   **Dollar Depreciation:** De-dollarization could lead to a broad depreciation of the dollar and underperformance of U.S. financial assets [jpmorgan](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3].\n*   **Impact on U.S. Assets:** Divestment or reallocation away from U.S. markets could negatively impact U.S. equities [jpmorgan](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3]. There could be upward pressure on real yields due to partial divestment of U.S. fixed income [jpmorgan](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3].\n*   **Shift in Global Power:** De-dollarization could shift the balance of power among countries, potentially reshaping the global economy and markets [jpmorgan](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-3]. A power vacuum could be filled by countries like China, which could have detrimental effects on U.S. security and economic stability [atlanticcouncil](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1].\n\n**Mitigating Negative Impacts:**\n\nTo mitigate the potential negative impacts of losing reserve currency status, the U.S. could implement several policies:\n\n*   **Fiscal Responsibility:** Reduce the national debt and maintain global trust in America's creditworthiness [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). Avoid defaulting on federal obligations [bipartisanpolicy](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0].\n*   **Increased Productivity:** Boost productivity growth through investment in innovation and technology [mckinsey](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [newyorkfed](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4].\n*   **International Cooperation:** Strengthen alliances, maintain open trade, and resolve tariff disputes [atlanticcouncil](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOverall, it is not clear whether the U.S. would be better off without the dollar as the global reserve currency. While there might be some benefits to losing this status, such as increased competitiveness, the potential downsides, such as increased borrowing costs and a weaker global influence, are significant. To mitigate these risks, the U.S. should focus on fiscal responsibility, increased productivity, and international cooperation.",

      "ai_message": "The term \"pre-service teacher\" generally refers to an individual who is currently enrolled in a teacher education program and is in the process of completing the necessary academic training to become a licensed or certified teacher [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1). These individuals, also known as teacher candidates [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-0) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/0-1) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-0) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1), are students at a college or university who are completing coursework and field experiences to meet the requirements for teacher certification [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [fiveable](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2) [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0). They have been accepted into the teacher education program but have yet to complete the requirements for full certification as a teacher [igi-global](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1).\n\nThe expression \"pre-service teacher\" is used to differentiate between tertiary students and school students [psu](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-3). The term is used to describe the education and training provided to student teachers before they have undertaken any teaching [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-4). The term \"prospective teacher\" is occasionally used in the literature as well [cambridgescholars](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-5).\n\nInternationally, pre-service teacher education is recognized as the formal training programs designed to prepare future educators [unesco](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0). These programs aim to equip prospective teachers with the foundational knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary for managing classrooms and facilitating learning [fiveable](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). Pre-service teacher education is also known as initial teacher education or initial teacher training and refers to 'recognized and organized, private and public educational programs designed to train future teachers to formally enter the profession at a specified level of education [unesco](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0). Graduates receive a government-recognized teaching qualification [unesco](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that pre-service teacher education varies significantly across countries [unesco](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [unesco](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0). This variation is evident in several key aspects:\n\n*   **Program Duration:** The length of pre-service training programs can differ significantly, ranging from two to three years in many low- and middle-income countries [globalpartnership](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-2) to as long as 6.5 years in countries like Germany [oecd](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-3). The duration typically varies from 2 to 5 years; the most common duration is 3 years [unesco](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-5).\n*   **Curriculum Content:** While most initial training programs include subject content, pedagogic content knowledge, education studies, and teaching practice [unesco](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-0), the specific content and emphasis can vary. Some curricula incorporate indigenous cultural elements [hrmars](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-6), while others focus on educational psychology, history, and sociology [bgsu](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-7).\n*   **Integration of Theory and Practice:** Successful programs often emphasize practical classroom experience, ongoing professional development, and alignment with the specific needs of students and society [edujavare](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-10) [researchgate](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-11). A major focus in the pre-service education program is the practicum - the pre-service teacher is placed within a school setting (either elementary or senior) and shadows an experienced teacher [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/3-1).",

'경상청년반탄핵연대' 소속 15명의 학생들은 경산시청 인근에서 \"경상청년 반탄핵 선언\"을 통해 윤 대통령의 탄핵에 대한 반대 입장을 밝혔는데요 [zum](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-0) [ajunews](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [ppomppu](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n\n이들은 윤 대통령의 계엄령 선포가 대통령의 고유 권한이며, 내란의 요소가 없었다고 주장했습니다 [ajunews](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-1) [ppomppu](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2). 또한, 더불어민주당이 행정부 예산을 삭감하고 29건의 탄핵을 추진하여 견제와 균형 시스템을 무너뜨렸다고 비판하며, 대통령이 좌파 정당의 현실을 국민에게 알리기 위해 계엄령을 선포할 수밖에 없었다고 주장했습니다 [ppomppu](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/1-2).\n\n이러한 학생들의 움직임은 탄핵 정국에 대한 다양한 시각을 보여주는 중요한 사례라고 할 수 있습니다.\n\n### 5. 앞으로 대한민국은?\n\n윤석열 대통령 탄핵이라는 초유의 사태를 겪으면서, 대한민국은 새로운 기로에 서 있습니다. 조기 대선을 통해 새로운 지도자를 선출하고, 혼란스러운 정국을 안정시켜야 하는 과제를 안고 있는데요.\n\n헌법재판소는 윤 대통령 탄핵심판 과정에서 전문법칙을 완화하여 적용할 수 있다는 의견과 함께, 앞으로는 전문법칙을 보다 엄격하게 적용할 필요가 있다는 의견이 제시되기도 했습니다.\n\n대통령 공석 상태는 헌정 위기로 이어질 수 있다는 지적이 제기되면서 [ihalla](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1), 탄핵소추된 대통령은 혐의를 벗고 대통령직에 복귀할 수 있도록 심판 절차 진행에 적극 협력해야 한다는 주장이 나왔습니다.\n\n정치적 혼란을 최소화하기 위해 헌법재판소가 만장일치 결정을 내리도록 노력할 것이라는 관측이 있었으나 [ihalla](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [wikipedia](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-1), 재판관들의 다양한 의견으로 인해 결론 도출에 어려움이 있을 것이라는 분석도 있었습니다.\n\n향후 정치 및 정책 환경 변화에 기업들이 적절하게 대응할 수 있도록 대선 공약을 체계적, 통합적으로 분석하고 시의적절한 정보를 제공하는 것이 중요하다는 의견이 제시되었습니다 [shinkim](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3) [yna](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-7) [koreanbar](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-6) [worklaw](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-4) [shinkim](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-3) [shinkim](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.googl [sisa-news](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5)e.com/id/2-3) [ihalla](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-2) [sisa-news](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/id/2-5).\n\n우리 모두가 대한민국의 미래를 위해 관심을 가지고 지켜봐야 할 때입니다.\n\n**[참고 자료]**\n\n*   [연합뉴스](https://www.yna.co.kr/)\n*   [위키백과](https://ko.wikipedia.org/)\n*   [중앙일보](https://www.joongang.co.kr/)\n*   [에이주뉴스](https://www.ajunews.com/)\n\n**[사진]**\n\n(탄핵 관련 시위 사진, 헌법재판소 사진, 경산 중고생 시국 선언 사진 등 관련 사진 삽입)\n\n**[마무리]**\n\n오늘은 윤석열 대통령 탄핵 사건과 그 이후의 정치적 파장에 대해 알아보았습니다. 탄핵이라는 어려운 과정을 통해 대한민국은 더욱 성숙해지고 발전할 수 있을 것이라고 믿습니다. 앞으로도 대한민국의 미래에 많은 관심 부탁드립니다!",
